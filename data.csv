"Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures
that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and
technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling,
and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates
game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical
networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation
management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical
systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism
design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling
interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges
addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale
system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual
agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the
integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient,
and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of
these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with
system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.","['Quanyan Zhu', 'Tamer Başar']",2,0.5982904
"With the advent of social media networks and the vast amount of information
circulating through them, automatic fact verification is an essential component
to prevent the spread of misinformation. It is even more useful to have fact
verification systems that provide explanations along with their classifications
to ensure accurate predictions. To address both of these requirements, we
implement AMREx, an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)-based veracity
prediction and explanation system for fact verification using a combination of
Smatch, an AMR evaluation metric to measure meaning containment and textual
similarity, and demonstrate its effectiveness in producing partially
explainable justifications using two community standard fact verification
datasets, FEVER and AVeriTeC. AMREx surpasses the AVeriTec baseline accuracy
showing the effectiveness of our approach for real-world claim verification. It
follows an interpretable pipeline and returns an explainable AMR node mapping
to clarify the system's veracity predictions when applicable. We further
demonstrate that AMREx output can be used to prompt LLMs to generate
natural-language explanations using the AMR mappings as a guide to lessen the
probability of hallucinations.","['Chathuri Jayaweera', 'Sangpil Youm', 'Bonnie Dorr']",1,0.7115773
"Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of
political reality. As the significance of narratives for understanding current
societal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly
evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical
analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided
method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals
from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).
The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of
political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived
political speeches, social media posts, political manifestos and transcripts of
parliamentary debates. We conceptualize these political narratives as a type of
ontological narratives: stories by which actors position themselves as
political beings, and which are akin to political worldviews in which actors
present their normative vision of the world, or aspects thereof. We approach
the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval:
starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of
the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable
concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these
graphs for representations of 1) actors, 2) the events in which these actors
figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach
these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core
narrative signals that initiate a further analysis by alluding to larger
political narratives. By means of a case study of State of the European Union
addresses, we demonstrate how the formalism can be used to inductively surface
signals of political narratives from public discourse.","['Armin Pournaki', 'Tom Willaert']",0,0.58086175
"Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content
retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or
potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of
large language models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model with
adaptive filtering for retrieval-augmented generation (E2E-AFG), which
integrates answer existence judgment and text generation into a single
end-to-end framework. This enables the model to focus more effectively on
relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and
generating accurate answers. We evaluate E2E-AFG on six representative
knowledge-intensive language datasets, and the results show that it
consistently outperforms baseline models across all tasks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.","['Yun Jiang', 'Zilong Xie', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yun Fang', 'Shuai Pan']",1,0.7031169
"In this paper, we introduce the first release of a large-scale dataset

"Recently, there has been an explosion of large language models created
through fine-tuning with data from larger models. These small models able to
produce outputs that appear qualitatively similar to significantly larger
models. However, one of the key limitations that have been observed with these
models is their propensity to hallucinate significantly more often than larger
models. In particular, they have been observed to generate coherent outputs
that involve factually incorrect information and spread misinformation,
toxicity, and stereotypes. There are many potential causes of hallucination, of
which, one hypothesis is that fine-tuning a model on data produced by a larger
model leads to a knowledge mismatch which contributes to hallucination. In
particular, it is hypothesized that there is a mismatch between the knowledge
that is fed to the model to fine-tune it and the knowledge that is already
present in the graph. Fine-tuning the model on data that has such mismatch
could contribute to an increased propensity to hallucinate. We show that on an
unseen test set, a smaller model fine-tuned on data generated from a larger
model produced more wrong answers when compared to models fine-tuned on data
created by the small model, which confirms the hypothesis.","['Phil Wee', 'Riyadh Baghdadi']",1,0.5473321
"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses key limitations of large
language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge, by
incorporating external databases. These databases typically consult multiple
sources to encompass up-to-date and various information. However, standard RAG
methods often overlook the heterogeneous source reliability in the multi-source
database and retrieve documents solely based on relevance, making them prone to
propagating misinformation. To address this, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG
(RA-RAG) which estimates the reliability of multiple sources and incorporates
this information into both retrieval and aggregation processes. Specifically,
it iteratively estimates source reliability and true answers for a set of
queries with no labelling. Then, it selectively retrieves relevant documents
from a few of reliable sources and aggregates them using weighted majority
voting, where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not
compromising the performance. We also introduce a benchmark designed to reflect
real-world scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability and demonstrate the
effectiveness of RA-RAG compared to a set of baselines.","['Jeongyeon Hwang', 'Junyoung Park', 'Hyejin Park', 'Sangdon Park', 'Jungseul Ok']",1,0.6805981
"Developing algorithms to differentiate between machine-generated texts and
human-written texts has garnered substantial attention in recent years.
Existing methods in this direction typically concern an offline setting where a
dataset containing a mix of real and machine-generated texts is given upfront,
and the task is to determine whether each sample in the dataset is from a large
language model (LLM) or a human. However, in many practical scenarios, sources
such as news websites, social media accounts, or on other forums publish
content in a streaming fashion. Therefore, in this online scenario, how to
quickly and accurately determine whether the source is an LLM with strong
statistical guarantees is crucial for these media or platforms to function
effectively and prevent the spread of misinformation and other potential misuse
of LLMs. To tackle the problem of online detection, we develop an algorithm
based on the techniques of sequential hypothesis testing by betting that not
only builds upon and complements existing offline detection techniques but also
enjoys statistical guarantees, which include a controlled false positive rate
and the expected time to correctly identify a source as an LLM. Experiments
were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","['Can Chen', 'Jun-Kun Wang']",1,0.7144151
"Social network platforms (SNP), such as X and TikTok, rely heavily on
user-generated content to attract users and advertisers, yet they have limited
control over content provision, which leads to the proliferation of
misinformation across platforms. As countermeasures, SNPs have implemented
various policies, such as tweet labeling, to notify users about potentially
misleading information, influencing users' responses, either favorably or
unfavorably, to the tagged contents. The population-level response creates a
social nudge to the content provider that encourages it to supply more
authentic content without exerting direct control over the provider. Yet, when
designing such tagging policies to leverage social nudges, SNP must be cautious
about the potential misdetection of misinformation (wrongly detecting factual
content as misinformation and vice versa), which impairs its credibility to
generic users and, hence, its ability to create social nudges. This work
establishes a Bayesian persuaded branching process to study SNP's tagging
policy design under misdetection. Misinformation circulation is modeled by a
multi-type branching process, where users are persuaded through tagging to give
positive and negative comments that influence the spread of misinformation.
When translated into posterior belief space, the SNP's problem is reduced to an
equality-constrained convex optimization, the optimal condition of which is
given by the Lagrangian characterization. The key finding is that SNP's optimal
policy is simply transparent tagging, i.e., revealing the content's
authenticity to the user, albeit midsection, which nudges the provider not to
generate misinformation. We corroborate our findings using numerical
simulations.","['Ya-Ting Yang', 'Tao Li', 'Quanyan Zhu']",1,0.6069323

paper, we characterize literature surrounding toxicity, formalize a definition
of toxicity, propose a novel cycle of internet extremism, list current
approaches to toxicity detection, outline future directions to minimize
toxicity in future social media endeavors, and identify current gaps in

"Information-seeking dialogues span a wide range of questions, from simple
factoid to complex queries that require exploring multiple facets and
viewpoints. When performing exploratory searches in unfamiliar domains, users
may lack background knowledge and struggle to verify the system-provided
information, making them vulnerable to misinformation. We investigate the
limitations of response generation in conversational information-seeking
systems, highlighting potential inaccuracies, pitfalls, and biases in the
responses. The study addresses the problem of query answerability and the
challenge of response incompleteness. Our user studies explore how these issues
impact user experience, focusing on users' ability to identify biased,
incorrect, or incomplete responses. We design two crowdsourcing tasks to assess
user experience with different system response variants, highlighting critical
issues to be addressed in future conversational information-seeking research.
Our analysis reveals that it is easier for users to detect response
incompleteness than query answerability and user satisfaction is mostly
associated with response diversity, not factual correctness.","['Weronika Łajewska', 'Krisztian Balog', 'Damiano Spina', 'Johanne Trippas']",0,0.65335727
"This study systematically analyzes the vulnerability of 36 large language

carefully crafted prompts to elicit malicious LLM behavior. Across 144 prompt
injection tests, we observed a strong correlation between model parameters and

random forest feature analysis, indicating that parameter size and architecture
significantly influence susceptibility. Results revealed that 56 percent of

"The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised
significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement.
Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images
and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new
watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into
diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking
throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples
these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the
image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the
watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it
from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show
that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data
generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments
further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking
methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes will be released at

"Fact-checking is extensively studied in the context of misinformation and
disinformation, addressing objective inaccuracies. However, a softer form of
misinformation involves responses that are factually correct but lack certain
features such as clarity and relevance. This challenge is prevalent in formal
Question-Answer (QA) settings such as press conferences in finance, politics,
sports, and other domains, where subjective answers can obscure transparency.
Despite this, there is a lack of manually annotated datasets for subjective
features across multiple dimensions. To address this gap, we introduce

QA sessions as the answers given by company representatives are often open to
subjective interpretations and scrutiny. The dataset includes 49,446

"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4

LLMs can autonomously create text-based games based on anthropological
classics, evaluating also their effectiveness in communicating knowledge. To
achieve this, the study engaged anthropologists in discussions to gather their
expectations and design inputs for an anthropologically themed game. Through
iterative processes following the established HCI principle of 'design

were refined. Leveraging GPT3.5, the study created three prototypes of games
centered around the seminal anthropological work of the social anthropologist's
Bronislaw Malinowski's ""Argonauts of the Western Pacific"" (1922). Subsequently,
evaluations were conducted by inviting senior anthropologists to playtest these
games, and based on their inputs, the game designs were refined. The tests
revealed promising outcomes but also highlighted key challenges: the models
encountered difficulties in providing in-depth thematic understandings, showed
suspectibility to misinformation, tended towards monotonic responses after an
extended period of play, and struggled to offer detailed biographical

"The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach is used to reduce the
confabulation of large language models (LLMs) for question answering by
retrieving and providing additional context coming from external knowledge
sources (e.g., by adding the context to the prompt). However, injecting
incorrect information can mislead the LLM to generate an incorrect answer.
  In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of four LLMs
against misinformation - Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama~3.1, and Mixtral - in
answering biomedical questions. We assess the answer accuracy on yes-no and
free-form questions in three scenarios: vanilla LLM answers (no context is
provided), ""perfect"" augmented generation (correct context is provided), and
prompt-injection attacks (incorrect context is provided). Our results show that
Llama 3.1 (70B parameters) achieves the highest accuracy in both vanilla
(0.651) and ""perfect"" RAG (0.802) scenarios. However, the accuracy gap between
the models almost disappears with ""perfect"" RAG, suggesting its potential to
mitigate the LLM's size-related effectiveness differences.
  We further evaluate the ability of the LLMs to generate malicious context on
one hand and the LLM's robustness against prompt-injection attacks on the other
hand, using metrics such as attack success rate (ASR), accuracy under attack,
and accuracy drop. As adversaries, we use the same four LLMs (Gemma 2,
GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral) to generate incorrect context that is
injected in the target model's prompt. Interestingly, Llama is shown to be the
most effective adversary, causing accuracy drops of up to 0.48 for vanilla
answers and 0.63 for ""perfect"" RAG across target models. Our analysis reveals
that robustness rankings vary depending on the evaluation measure, highlighting
the complexity of assessing LLM resilience to adversarial attacks.","['Alexander Bondarenko', 'Adrian Viehweger']",6,0.7379272

"With the growing spread of misinformation online, research has increasingly
focused on detecting and tracking fake news. However, an overlooked issue is
that fake news does not naturally exist in social networks -- it often
originates from distorted facts or deliberate fabrication by malicious actors.
Understanding how true news gradually evolves into fake news is critical for
early detection and prevention, reducing its spread and impact. Hence, in this
paper, we take the first step toward simulating and revealing this evolution,
proposing a Fake News evolUtion Simulation framEwork (FUSE) based on large
language models (LLMs). Specifically, we employ LLM as agents to represent
individuals in a simulated social network. We define four types of agents
commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders, who propagate information;
commentators, who provide opinions and interpretations; verifiers, who check
the accuracy of information; and bystanders, who passively observe without
engaging. For simulated environments, we model various social network
structures, such as high-clustering networks and scale-free networks, to mirror
real-world network dynamics. Each day, the agents engage in belief exchanges,
reflect on their thought processes, and reintroduce the news accordingly. Given
the lack of prior work in this area, we developed a FUSE-EVAL evaluation
framework to measure the deviation from true news during the fake news
evolution process. The results show that FUSE successfully captures the
underlying patterns of how true news transforms into fake news and accurately
reproduces previously discovered instances of fake news, aligning closely with
human evaluations. Moreover, our work provides insights into the fact that
combating fake news should not be delayed until it has fully evolved; instead,
prevention in advance is key to achieving better outcomes.","['Yuhan Liu', 'Zirui Song', 'Xiaoqing Zhang', 'Xiuying Chen', 'Rui Yan']",4,0.8088968

"Social media is often the first place where communities discuss the latest
societal trends. Prior works have utilized this platform to extract
epidemic-related information (e.g. infections, preventive measures) to provide
early warnings for epidemic prediction. However, these works only focused on
English posts, while epidemics can occur anywhere in the world, and early
discussions are often in the local, non-English languages. In this work, we
introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for
extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and
languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument
roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in
four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is
infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e.,
training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and
show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse
languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework
can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019

"Influence maximization (IM) is a classic problem that aims to identify a
small group of critical individuals, known as seeds, who can influence the
largest number of users in a social network through word-of-mouth. This problem
finds important applications including viral marketing, infection detection,
and misinformation containment. The conventional IM problem is typically
studied with the oversimplified goal of selecting a single seed set. Many
real-world scenarios call for multiple sets of seeds, particularly on social
media platforms where various viral marketing campaigns need different sets of
seeds to propagate effectively. To this end, previous works have formulated
various IM variants, central to which is the requirement of multiple seed sets,
naturally modeled as a matroid constraint. However, the current best-known
solutions for these variants either offer a weak
$(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation, or offer a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm that is very expensive. We propose an efficient seed selection method
called AMP, an algorithm with a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation guarantee for
this family of IM variants. To further improve efficiency, we also devise a
fast implementation, called RAMP. We extensively evaluate the performance of
our proposal against 6 competitors across 4 IM variants and on 7 real-world

"The rise of social media and short-form video (SFV) has facilitated a
breeding ground for misinformation. With the emergence of large language

with automatic false claim detection for text. Unfortunately, the automatic
detection of misinformation in SFV is a more complex problem that remains
largely unstudied. While text samples are monomodal (only containing words),
SFVs comprise three different modalities: words, visuals, and non-linguistic
audio. In this work, we introduce Video Masked Autoencoders for Misinformation

video to discern its intention; specifically whether it intends to make an
informative claim. If it is deemed that the SFV has informative intent, it is
passed through our second component: a Retrieval Augmented Generation system

LLMs, we propose diverse single-round and multi-round prompting schemes,
applying different task-specific instructions such as extraction,

"Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to persuasion, which can pose
risks when models are faced with an adversarial interlocutor. We take a first
step towards defending models against persuasion while also arguing that
defense against adversarial (i.e. negative) persuasion is only half of the
equation: models should also be able to accept beneficial (i.e. positive)
persuasion to improve their answers. We show that optimizing models for only
one side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positive
and negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Balanced Training (or PBT),
which leverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trains
models via preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBT
consistently improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to being
challenged while also resulting in the best overall performance on holistic
data containing both positive and negative persuasion. Crucially, we show that
PBT models are better teammates in multi-agent debates. We find that without
PBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable performance, with the
order in which the models present their answers determining whether the team
obtains the stronger or weaker model's performance. PBT leads to better and

"The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought impressive
performances on mitigation strategies against misinformation, such as

outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. In
order to circumvent these issues, we propose a new task, namely, Critical
Questions Generation, consisting of processing an argumentative text to
generate the critical questions (CQs) raised by it. In argumentation theory CQs
are tools designed to lay bare the blind spots of an argument by pointing at
the information it could be missing. Thus, instead of trying to deploy LLMs to
produce knowledgeable and relevant counterarguments, we use them to question
arguments, without requiring any external knowledge. Research on CQs Generation
using LLMs requires a reference dataset for large scale experimentation. Thus,
in this work we investigate two complementary methods to create such a
resource: (i) instantiating CQs templates as defined by Walton's argumentation
theory and (ii), using LLMs as CQs generators. By doing so, we contribute with

"The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, has

Role Recognition (LLM-RR), a multi-class classification task that identifies
specific roles of LLM in content generation, and LLM Influence Measurement
(LLM-IM), a regression task that quantifies the extent of LLM involvement in

"In this study, we investigate the under-explored intervention planning aimed
at disseminating accurate information within dynamic opinion networks by
leveraging learning strategies. Intervention planning involves identifying key
nodes (search) and exerting control (e.g., disseminating accurate or official

However, as the network size increases, the problem becomes computationally
intractable. To address this, we first introduce a ranking algorithm to
identify key nodes for disseminating accurate information, which facilitates
the training of neural network classifiers that provide generalized solutions
for the search and planning problems. Second, we mitigate the complexity of

a reinforcement learning-based centralized dynamic planning framework. We
analyze these NN-based planners for opinion networks governed by two dynamic
propagation models. Each model incorporates both binary and continuous opinion
and trust representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
ranking algorithm-based classifiers provide plans that enhance infection rate
control, especially with increased action budgets for small networks. Further,

number of susceptible nodes and infection rates, outperform those prioritizing
faster blocking strategies. Additionally, our findings reveal that graph

facts. Such efforts are often hampered by challenges with scalability, and by
platform users' personal biases. The emergence of generative AI presents
promising opportunities for countering misinformation at scale across
ideological barriers.
  In this paper, we introduce a framework (MisinfoEval) for generating and
comprehensively evaluating large language model (LLM) based misinformation
interventions. We present (1) an experiment with a simulated social media
environment to measure effectiveness of misinformation interventions, and (2) a
second experiment with personalized explanations tailored to the demographics
and beliefs of users with the goal of countering misinformation by appealing to
their pre-existing values. Our findings confirm that LLM-based interventions
are highly effective at correcting user behavior (improving overall user
accuracy at reliability labeling by up to 41.72%). Furthermore, we find that
users favor more personalized interventions when making decisions about news
reliability and users shown personalized interventions have significantly
higher accuracy at identifying misinformation.","['Saadia Gabriel', 'Liang Lyu', 'James Siderius', 'Marzyeh Ghassemi', 'Jacob Andreas', 'Asu Ozdaglar']",0,0.73211205
"This paper introduces misinfo-general, a benchmark dataset for evaluating
misinformation models' ability to perform out-of-distribution generalisation.
Misinformation changes rapidly, much quicker than moderators can annotate at
scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data
distributions. As a result, misinformation models need to be able to perform
out-of-distribution generalisation, an understudied problem in existing
datasets. We identify 6 axes of generalisation-time, event, topic, publisher,
political bias, misinformation type-and design evaluation procedures for each.

"This study investigates who should bear the responsibility of combating the
spread of misinformation in social networks. Should that be the online
platforms or their users? Should that be done by debunking the ""fake news""
already in circulation or by investing in preemptive efforts to prevent their
diffusion altogether? We seek to answer such questions in a stylized opinion
dynamics framework, where agents in a network aggregate the information they
receive from peers and/or from influential external sources, with the aim of
learning a ground truth among a set of competing hypotheses. In most cases, we
find centralized sources to be more effective at combating misinformation than
distributed ones, suggesting that online platforms should play an active role
in the fight against fake news. In line with literature on the ""backfire
effect"", we find that debunking in certain circumstances can be a
counterproductive strategy, whereas some targeted strategies (akin to
""deplatforming"") and/or preemptive campaigns turn out to be quite effective.

damaging effects.","['Diana Riazi', 'Giacomo Livan']",4,0.7168596
"Language models (LMs) are known to suffer from hallucinations and
misinformation. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) that retrieves verifiable
information from an external knowledge corpus to complement the parametric
knowledge in LMs provides a tangible solution to these problems. However, the
generation quality of RAG is highly dependent on the relevance between a user's
query and the retrieved documents. Inaccurate responses may be generated when
the query is outside of the scope of knowledge represented in the external
knowledge corpus or if the information in the corpus is out-of-date. In this
work, we establish a statistical framework that assesses how well a query can
be answered by an RAG system by capturing the relevance of knowledge. We
introduce an online testing procedure that employs goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests
to inspect the relevance of each user query to detect out-of-knowledge queries
with low knowledge relevance. Additionally, we develop an offline testing
framework that examines a collection of user queries, aiming to detect
significant shifts in the query distribution which indicates the knowledge
corpus is no longer sufficiently capable of supporting the interests of the
users. We demonstrate the capabilities of these strategies through a systematic
evaluation on eight question-answering (QA) datasets, the results of which
indicate that the new testing framework is an efficient solution to enhance the

"Multimodal encoders like CLIP excel in tasks such as zero-shot image

unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps
unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to
retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of
unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the
need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA
outperforms CLIP while requiring $300,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs

availability of large amounts of labeled data, which is often impractical in
real-world, since it requires extensive manual intervention and domain

"Background: Large language models (LLMs) are trained to follow directions,
but this introduces a vulnerability to blindly comply with user requests even
if they generate wrong information. In medicine, this could accelerate the
generation of misinformation that impacts human well-being.
  Objectives/Methods: We analyzed compliance to requests to generate misleading
content about medications in settings where models know the request is
illogical. We investigated whether in-context directions and instruction-tuning
of LLMs to prioritize logical reasoning over compliance reduced misinformation
risk.
  Results: While all frontier LLMs complied with misinformation requests, both
prompt-based and parameter-based approaches can improve the detection of logic
flaws in requests and prevent the dissemination of medical misinformation.
  Conclusion: Shifting LLMs to prioritize logic over compliance could reduce
risks of exploitation for medical misinformation.","['Shan Chen', 'Mingye Gao', 'Kuleen Sasse', 'Thomas Hartvigsen', 'Brian Anthony', 'Lizhou Fan', 'Hugo Aerts', 'Jack Gallifant', 'Danielle Bitterman']",6,0.7320219

"In an increasingly interconnected world, a key scientific challenge is to
examine mechanisms that lead to the widespread propagation of contagions, such
as misinformation and pathogens, and identify risk factors that can trigger
large-scale outbreaks. Underlying both the spread of disease and misinformation
epidemics is the evolution of the contagion as it propagates, leading to the
emergence of different strains, e.g., through genetic mutations in pathogens
and alterations in the information content. Recent studies have revealed that
models that do not account for heterogeneity in transmission risks associated
with different strains of the circulating contagion can lead to inaccurate
predictions. However, existing results on multi-strain spreading assume that
the network has a vanishingly small clustering coefficient, whereas clustering
is widely known to be a fundamental property of real-world social networks. In

discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies
to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically
examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input

strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions
to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also
probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from
human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and

"In the past decade, social media platforms have been used for information
dissemination and consumption. While a major portion of the content is posted
to promote citizen journalism and public awareness, some content is posted to
mislead users. Among different content types such as text, images, and videos,
memes (text overlaid on images) are particularly prevalent and can serve as
powerful vehicles for propaganda, hate, and humor. In the current literature,
there have been efforts to individually detect such content in memes. However,
the study of their intersection is very limited. In this study, we explore the
intersection between propaganda and hate in memes using a multi-agent LLM-based

reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to
misinformation. We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art
LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA
scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge
drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models. We
evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on
Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics. Our experiments reveal that
an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered
incorrectly due to the exposure to false information. At the same time,
repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models
uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t. the answers on the untainted prompts),
potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift
from its original knowledge. These findings provide insights into LLMs'

"In recent years there have been a growing interest in online auditing of
information flow over social networks with the goal of monitoring undesirable
effects, such as, misinformation and fake news. Most previous work on the
subject, focus on the binary classification problem of classifying information
as fake or genuine. Nonetheless, in many practical scenarios, the
multi-class/label setting is of particular importance. For example, it could be
the case that a social media platform may want to distinguish between ``true"",
``partly-true"", and ``false"" information. Accordingly, in this paper, we
consider the problem of online multiclass classification of information flow.
To that end, driven by empirical studies on information flow over real-world
social media networks, we propose a probabilistic information flow model over
graphs. Then, the learning task is to detect the label of the information flow,
with the goal of minimizing a combination of the classification error and the
detection time. For this problem, we propose two detection algorithms; the
first is based on the well-known multiple sequential probability ratio test,
while the second is a novel graph neural network based sequential decision
algorithm. For both algorithms, we prove several strong statistical guarantees.
We also construct a data driven algorithm for learning the proposed
probabilistic model. Finally, we test our algorithms over two real-world

"Advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized the way we
can interact with digital information systems, such as databases, making them
more accessible. However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is
critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination
problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data,
potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel
approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM)

question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the
LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the
syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used

"Fake news detection remains a critical challenge in today's rapidly evolving
digital landscape, where misinformation can spread faster than ever before.
Traditional fake news detection models often rely on static datasets and
auxiliary information, such as metadata or social media interactions, which
limits their adaptability to real-time scenarios. Recent advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in addressing
these challenges due to their extensive pre-trained knowledge and ability to
analyze textual content without relying on auxiliary data. However, many of
these LLM-based approaches are still rooted in static datasets, with limited
exploration into their real-time processing capabilities. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of both traditional offline models and state-of-the-art

existing offline models, including their inability to adapt to dynamic
misinformation patterns. Furthermore, we show that newer LLM models with online

detecting emerging fake news in real-time contexts. Our findings emphasize the
importance of transitioning from offline to online LLM models for real-time

"Leveraging recent advances in wireless communication, IoT, and AI,
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) played an important role in reducing
traffic congestion and enhancing user experience. Within ITS, navigational
recommendation systems (NRS) are essential for helping users simplify route
choices in urban environments. However, NRS are vulnerable to information-based
attacks that can manipulate both the NRS and users to achieve the objectives of
the malicious entities. This study aims to assess the risks of misinformed
demand attacks, where attackers use techniques like Sybil-based attacks to
manipulate the demands of certain origins and destinations considered by the
NRS. We propose a game-theoretic framework for proactive risk assessment of
demand attacks (PRADA) and treat the interaction between attackers and the NRS
as a Stackelberg game. The attacker is the leader who conveys misinformed

Specifically, we consider the case of local-targeted attacks, in which the
attacker aims to make the NRS recommend the authentic users towards a specific
road that favors certain groups. Our analysis unveils the equivalence between
users' incentive compatibility and Wardrop equilibrium recommendations and
shows that the NRS and its users are at high risk when encountering intelligent
attackers who can significantly alter user routes by strategically fabricating
non-existent demands. To mitigate these risks, we introduce a trust mechanism
that leverages users' confidence in the integrity of the NRS, and show that it

"Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by
researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is costly and

differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation

demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily
tweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low
factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that
higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared

some of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and
the number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a
user has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network

manipulation and transformation cues, thereby providing concrete evidence
chains. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework

while previous methods primarily focus on identifying tampering traces only
between image pairs, they often overlook the hidden information embedded in the
topology of the provenance graph. Our approach aligns the model training
objectives with the final graph construction task, incorporating the overall

"The rapid dissemination of misinformation on the internet complicates the
decision-making process for individuals seeking reliable information,
particularly parents researching child development topics. This misinformation
can lead to adverse consequences, such as inappropriate treatment of children

predict child abuse cases, there has been a gap in the analysis of child
development myths and facts. This study addresses this gap by applying text
mining techniques and classification models to distinguish between myths and
facts about child development, leveraging newly gathered data from publicly

text mining techniques were employed to pre-process the data, ensuring enhanced
accuracy. Subsequently, the structured data was analysed using six robust

MissciPlus, an extension of the fallacy detection dataset Missci. MissciPlus
builds on Missci by grounding the applied fallacies in real-world passages from
misrepresented studies. This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and
verbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables

of digital content, improving forensic investigations, and mitigating the risks
of misinformation and plagiarism. Addressing the imperative need for proper
authorship attribution is essential to uphold the credibility and
accountability of authentic authorship. The rapid advancements of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have blurred the lines between human and machine
authorship, posing significant challenges for traditional methods. We presents
a comprehensive literature review that examines the latest research on
authorship attribution in the era of LLMs. This survey systematically explores
the landscape of this field by categorizing four representative problems: (1)
Human-written Text Attribution; (2) LLM-generated Text Detection; (3)
LLM-generated Text Attribution; and (4) Human-LLM Co-authored Text Attribution.
We also discuss the challenges related to ensuring the generalization and
explainability of authorship attribution methods. Generalization requires the
ability to generalize across various domains, while explainability emphasizes
providing transparent and understandable insights into the decisions made by
these models. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing methods
and benchmarks, we identify key open problems and future research directions in
this field. This literature review serves a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners interested in understanding the state of the art in this rapidly

"The landscape of social media content has evolved significantly, extending
from text to multimodal formats. This evolution presents a significant
challenge in combating misinformation. Previous research has primarily focused
on single modalities or text-image combinations, leaving a gap in detecting
multimodal misinformation. While the concept of entity consistency holds
promise in detecting multimodal misinformation, simplifying the representation
to a scalar value overlooks the inherent complexities of high-dimensional
representations across different modalities. To address these limitations, we
propose a Multimedia Misinformation Detection (MultiMD) framework for detecting
misinformation from video content by leveraging cross-modal entity consistency.
The proposed dual learning approach allows for not only enhancing
misinformation detection performance but also improving representation learning
of entity consistency across different modalities. Our results demonstrate that
MultiMD outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and underscore the
importance of each modality in misinformation detection. Our research provides
novel methodological and technical insights into multimodal misinformation

"Disaster events often unfold rapidly, necessitating a swift and effective
response. Developing action plans, resource allocation, and resolution of help
requests in disaster scenarios is time-consuming and complex since
disaster-relevant information is often uncertain. Leveraging real-time data can
significantly deal with data uncertainty and enhance disaster response efforts.
To deal with real-time data uncertainty, social media appeared as an
alternative effective source of real-time data as there has been extensive use
of social media during and after the disasters. However, it also brings forth
challenges regarding trustworthiness and bias in these data. To fully leverage
social media data for disaster management, it becomes crucial to mitigate
biases that may arise due to specific disaster types or regional contexts.
Additionally, the presence of misinformation within social media data raises
concerns about the reliability of data sources, potentially impeding actionable
insights and leading to improper resource utilization. To overcome these
challenges, our research aimed to investigate how to ensure trustworthiness and
address biases in social media data. We aim to investigate and identify the
factors that can be used to enhance trustworthiness and minimize bias to make

"Misinformation - false or misleading information - is considered a
significant societal concern due to its associated ""misinformation effects,""
such as political polarization, erosion of trust in institutions, problematic
behavior, and public health challenges. However, the prevailing concept is
misaligned with what is studied. While misinformation focuses on instances of
information about factual matters, the broad spectrum of effects often
manifests at a societal level and is shaped by a wide range of interdependent
factors such as identity, values, opinions, epistemologies, and disagreements.
Unsurprisingly, misinformation effects can occur without the prevalence of
misinformation, and misinformation does not necessarily increase the effects
studied. Here, we propose using disagreement - conflicting attitudes and
beliefs between individuals and communities - as a way to study misinformation
effects because it addresses the identified conceptual limitations of
misinformation. Furthermore, unlike misinformation, disagreement does not
require researchers to determine whether a given information is false or
misleading. Thus, it can be studied and, more importantly, measured without the
need to make a normative judgment about a given information, even when the
specific topic is entirely removed, as we show in a longitudinal disagreement
measurement. We demonstrate that disagreement, as a holistic concept, provides
better explanations for the occurrence of misinformation effects, enhances
precision in developing appropriate interventions, and offers a promising
approach for evaluating them through quantification. Finally, we show how
disagreement addresses current misinformation research questions and conclude
with recommendations for research practice.","['Damian Hodel', 'Jevin West']",0,0.77806544

This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies,

"Social bots-automated accounts that generate and spread content on social
media-are exploiting vulnerabilities in these platforms to manipulate public
perception and disseminate disinformation. This has prompted the development of
public bot detection services; however, most of these services focus primarily
on Twitter, leaving niche platforms vulnerable. Fringe social media platforms
such as Parler, Gab, and Gettr often have minimal moderation, which facilitates
the spread of hate speech and misinformation. To address this gap, we introduce
Entendre, an open-access, scalable, and platform-agnostic bot detection
framework. Entendre can process a labeled dataset from any social platform to
produce a tailored bot detection model using a random forest classification
approach, ensuring robust social bot detection. We exploit the idea that most
social platforms share a generic template, where users can post content,
approve content, and provide a bio (common data features). By emphasizing
general data features over platform-specific ones, Entendre offers rapid
extensibility at the expense of some accuracy. To demonstrate Entendre's
effectiveness, we used it to explore the presence of bots among accounts

examined 233,000 posts from 38,379 unique users and found that 1,916 unique
users (4.99%) exhibited bot-like behavior. Visualization techniques further

"Recently, federated learning (FL) has achieved wide successes for diverse
privacy-sensitive applications without sacrificing the sensitive private
information of clients. However, the data quality of client datasets can not be
guaranteed since corresponding annotations of different clients often contain
complex label noise of varying degrees, which inevitably causes the performance
degradation. Intuitively, the performance degradation is dominated by clients
with higher noise rates since their trained models contain more misinformation
from data, thus it is necessary to devise an effective optimization scheme to
mitigate the negative impacts of these noisy clients. In this work, we propose
a two-stage framework FedELC to tackle this complicated label noise issue. The
first stage aims to guide the detection of noisy clients with higher label
noise, while the second stage aims to correct the labels of noisy clients' data
via an end-to-end label correction framework which is achieved by learning
possible ground-truth labels of noisy clients' datasets via back propagation.
We implement sixteen related methods and evaluate five datasets with three

through a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Social Network
Analysis (SNA) and graph visualization. The primary goal is to detect
misinformation, track its propagation, identify its sources, and assess the
influence of various actors within the network.
  Methods: DisTrack's architecture incorporates a variety of methodologies
including keyword search, semantic similarity assessments, and graph generation
techniques. These methods collectively facilitate the monitoring of
misinformation, the categorization of content based on alignment with known
false claims, and the visualization of dissemination cascades through detailed
graphs. The tool is tailored to capture and analyze the dynamic nature of
misinformation spread in digital environments.
  Results: The effectiveness of DisTrack is demonstrated through three case
studies focused on different themes: discredit/hate speech, anti-vaccine
misinformation, and false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These
studies show DisTrack's capabilities in distinguishing posts that propagate
falsehoods from those that counteract them, and tracing the evolution of
misinformation from its inception.
  Conclusions: The research confirms that DisTrack is a valuable tool in the

"This research investigates the extent of misinformation in certain
journalistic articles by introducing a novel measurement tool to assess the
degrees of falsity. It aims to measure misinformation using two metrics
(concealment and overstatement) to explore how information is interpreted as
false. This should help examine how articles containing partly true and partly
false information can potentially harm readers, as they are more challenging to
identify than completely fabricated information. In this study, the full story
provided by the fact-checking website serves as a standardized source of
information for comparing differences between fake and real news. The result
suggests that false news has greater concealment and overstatement, due to
longer and more complex new stories being shortened and ambiguously phrased.
While there are no major distinctions among categories of politics science and
civics, it demonstrates that misinformation lacks crucial details while
simultaneously containing more redundant words. Hence, news articles containing
partial falsity, categorized as misinformation, can deceive inattentive readers

curated a comprehensive, high-quality dataset, featuring the texts tampered by
eight text editing models, to thoroughly assess the open-set generalization
capabilities. Further, we introduce a novel and effective pre-training paradigm
that subtly alters the texture of selected texts within an image and trains the
model to identify these regions. This approach not only mitigates the scarcity
of high-quality training data but also enhances models' fine-grained perception

framework that improves open-set generalization by distinguishing between the
features of authentic and tampered text, rather than focusing solely on the

more persuasive than accurate and honest explanations, AI-generated deceptive
explanations can significantly amplify belief in false news headlines and
undermine true ones as compared to AI systems that simply classify the headline
incorrectly as being true/false. Moreover, our results show that personal
factors such as cognitive reflection and trust in AI do not necessarily protect
individuals from these effects caused by deceptive AI generated explanations.

the embedding spaces. Particularly, we find that the memorization scores
calculated from layer embeddings of Vision Transformers (ViTs) show an notable
trend - the latter (deeper) the layer, the less the memorization measured. It
has been found that the memorization scores from the early layers' embeddings
are more sensitive to low-level memorization (e.g. colors and simple patterns
for an image), while those from the latter layers are more sensitive to
high-level memorization (e.g. semantic meaning of an image). We also observe
that, for a specific model architecture, its degree of memorization on
different levels of information is unique. It can be viewed as an inherent
property of the architecture. Building upon this insight, we introduce a unique
fingerprinting methodology. This method capitalizes on the unique distributions
of the memorization score across different layers of ViTs, providing a novel

discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high
effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a bias
increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the
injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of
LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks,
measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of
LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical
evidence. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge

"Generative models, such as diffusion models (DMs), variational autoencoders
(VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs), produce images with a level
of authenticity that makes them nearly indistinguishable from real photos and
artwork. While this capability is beneficial for many industries, the
difficulty of identifying synthetic images leaves online media platforms
vulnerable to impersonation and misinformation attempts. To support the
development of defensive methods, we introduce ImagiNet, a high-resolution and
balanced dataset for synthetic image detection, designed to mitigate potential
biases in existing resources. It contains 200K examples, spanning four content
categories: photos, paintings, faces, and uncategorized. Synthetic images are
produced with open-source and proprietary generators, whereas real counterparts
of the same content type are collected from public datasets. The structure of
ImagiNet allows for a two-track evaluation system: i) classification as real or
synthetic and ii) identification of the generative model. To establish a
baseline, we train a ResNet-50 model using a self-supervised contrastive
objective (SelfCon) for each track. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance and high inference speed across established benchmarks, achieving
an AUC of up to 0.99 and balanced accuracy ranging from 86% to 95%, even under

"Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to
disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently.
However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse
aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely
identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has
become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex
phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In
this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation
and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles
and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity
discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a
set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the
existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of
articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder
structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the
token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon
these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by
Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of
DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The

"Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media
platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this
issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing
multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and
industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal
Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the
semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect
some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that
manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for
detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions
behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD.
Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning
manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as
well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the
manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make
these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose
two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional
datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification
tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we
propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD

"Deception plays a crucial role in strategic interactions with incomplete
information. Motivated by security applications, we study a class of two-player
turn-based deterministic games with one-sided incomplete information, in which
player 1 (P1) aims to prevent player 2 (P2) from reaching a set of target
states. In addition to actions, P1 can place two kinds of deception resources:
""traps"" and ""fake targets"" to disinform P2 about the transition dynamics and
payoff of the game. Traps ""hide the real"" by making trap states appear normal,
while fake targets ""reveal the fiction"" by advertising non-target states as
targets. We are interested in jointly synthesizing optimal decoy placement and
deceptive defense strategies for P1 that exploits P2's misinformation. We
introduce a novel hypergame on graph model and two solution concepts: stealthy
deceptive sure winning and stealthy deceptive almost-sure winning. These
identify states from which P1 can prevent P2 from reaching the target in a
finite number of steps or with probability one without allowing P2 to become
aware that it is being deceived. Consequently, determining the optimal decoy
placement corresponds to maximizing the size of P1's deceptive winning region.
Considering the combinatorial complexity of exploring all decoy allocations, we
utilize compositional synthesis concepts to show that the objective function
for decoy placement is monotone, non-decreasing, and, in certain cases, sub- or
super-modular. This leads to a greedy algorithm for decoy placement, achieving
a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation when the objective function is sub- or

"The increasing proliferation of misinformation and its alarming impact have
motivated both industry and academia to develop approaches for misinformation
detection and fact checking. Recent advances on large language models (LLMs)
have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs
could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most
of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and
solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided.
Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation
detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the
potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We
incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial
to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of
claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal
evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The
retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an
LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a
fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence
samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete

"Online platforms like Reddit, Wikipedia, and Facebook are integral to modern

need rules and oversight to maintain a safe and productive environment. As
these communities grow, a key question arises: how does the need for regulatory
functions scale? Do larger groups require more regulatory actions and oversight
per person, or can they manage with less? Our analysis of Reddit's regulatory
functions reveals robust scaling relationships across different subreddits,
suggesting universal patterns between community size and the amount of
regulation needed. We found that the number of comments and moderator actions,
such as comment removals, grew faster than the community size, with superlinear
exponents of 1.12 and 1.18, respectively. However, bot-based rule enforcement

exponent of 0.95. Further analysis of the residuals from these scaling
behaviors identified a 'trade-off axis,' where one-way coordination mechanisms

"This article examines public exposure to and perceptions of deepfakes based
on insights from a nationally representative survey of 1403 UK adults. The
survey is one of the first of its kind since recent improvements in deepfake
technology and widespread adoption of political deepfakes. The findings reveal
three key insights. First, on average, 15% of people report exposure to harmful
deepfakes, including deepfake pornography, deepfake frauds/scams and other
potentially harmful deepfakes such as those that spread health/religious
misinformation/propaganda. In terms of common targets, exposure to deepfakes
featuring celebrities was 50.2%, whereas those featuring politicians was 34.1%.
And 5.7% of respondents recall exposure to a selection of high profile
political deepfakes in the UK. Second, while exposure to harmful deepfakes was
relatively low, awareness of and fears about deepfakes were high (and women
were significantly more likely to report experiencing such fears than men). As
with fears, general concerns about the spread of deepfakes were also high;
90.4% of the respondents were either very concerned or somewhat concerned about
this issue. Most respondents (at least 91.8%) were concerned that deepfakes
could add to online child sexual abuse material, increase distrust in
information and manipulate public opinion. Third, while awareness about
deepfakes was high, usage of deepfake tools was relatively low (8%). Most
respondents were not confident about their detection abilities and were
trustful of audiovisual content online. Our work highlights how the problem of
deepfakes has become embedded in public consciousness in just a few years; it
also highlights the need for media literacy programmes and other policy
interventions to address the spread of harmful deepfakes.","['Tvesha Sippy', 'Florence Enock', 'Jonathan Bright', 'Helen Z. Margetts']",11,0.6454379

solutions in the literature. Various embedding techniques on multiple datasets
are used to represent information for the purpose. The diverse spectral and
non-spectral methods used on these embeddings include t-distributed Stochastic
Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs). Classification is done using multiple machine learning
algorithms. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Integrated Gradients are used for the

"Social computing scholars have long known that people do not interact with
knowledge in straightforward ways, especially in digital environments. While
policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are
value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine
non-traditional -- often non-Western -- ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is
the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon.
Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are
stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we
articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to
material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW
practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical
applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on
r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further
explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate
them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological
experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and
intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic
community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the
CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We
call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster
communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards
epistemic justice. In sum, we recount, synthesize, and propose solutions for
the various forms of epistemic injustice that CSCW sites of study -- including
CSCW itself -- propagate.","['Leah Hope Ajmani', 'Jasmine C Foriest', 'Jordan Taylor', 'Kyle Pittman', 'Sarah Gilbert', 'Michael Ann Devito']",0,0.65685964
"Social media platforms enhance the propagation of online misinformation by
providing large user bases with a quick means to share content. One way to
disrupt the rapid dissemination of misinformation at scale is through warning
tags, which label content as potentially false or misleading. Past warning tag
mitigation studies yield mixed results for diverse audiences, however. We
hypothesize that personalizing warning tags to the individual characteristics
of their diverse users may enhance mitigation effectiveness. To reach the goal
of personalization, we need to understand how people differ and how those
differences predict a person's attitudes and self-described behaviors toward
tags and tagged content. In this study, we leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk (n =
132) and undergraduate students (n = 112) to provide this foundational
understanding. Specifically, we find attitudes towards warning tags and
self-described behaviors are positively influenced by factors such as
Personality Openness and Agreeableness, Need for Cognitive Closure (NFCC),
Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) score, and Trust in Medical Scientists.
Conversely, Trust in Religious Leaders, Conscientiousness, and political

private WhatsApp groups collected with consent from participants, our study
uncovers the kinds of WhatsApp groups users are part of, marking the first such
categorization. The dataset comprises tens of thousands of messages, out of
which we manually classified 604 pieces of content designated as 'forwarded

  Our key findings indicate a high prevalence of content focused on national
politics, with the viral messages overwhelmingly supporting a specific
political party and disparaging the opposition. Significantly, these messages
were fraught with misinformation, engendering hate against Muslims and
promoting a narrative of Hindus being under threat. This trend was particularly
noticeable within caste-based groups, which were dominated by misinformation,
pro-BJP rhetoric, anti-Congress content, and Hindutva propaganda. Remarkably,
much of the misinformation circulating had previously been discredited by
established fact-checking organizations. This suggests not only a recurring
cycle of debunked information reappearing but also that fact-checks are failing

"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various natural language processing tasks. However, they are prone to
generating fluent yet untruthful responses, known as ""hallucinations"".
Hallucinations can lead to the spread of misinformation and cause harm in
critical applications. Mitigating hallucinations is challenging as they arise
from factors such as noisy data, model overconfidence, lack of knowledge, and
the generation process itself. Recent efforts have attempted to address this
issue through representation editing and decoding algorithms, reducing
hallucinations without major structural changes or retraining. However, these
approaches either implicitly edit LLMs' behavior in latent space or suppress
the tendency to output unfaithful results during decoding instead of explicitly
modeling on hallucination. In this work, we introduce Faithful Finetuning (F2),
a novel method that explicitly models the process of faithful question
answering through carefully designed loss functions during fine-tuning. We
conduct extensive experiments on popular datasets and demonstrate that F2
achieves significant improvements over vanilla models and baselines.","['Minda Hu', 'Bowei He', 'Yufei Wang', 'Liangyou Li', 'Chen Ma', 'Irwin King']",6,0.64230037
"Misinformation is prevalent in various fields such as education, politics,
health, etc., causing significant harm to society. However, current methods for
cross-domain misinformation detection rely on time and resources consuming
fine-tuning and complex model structures. With the outstanding performance of
LLMs, many studies have employed them for misinformation detection.
Unfortunately, they focus on in-domain tasks and do not incorporate significant
sentiment and emotion features (which we jointly call affect). In this paper,
we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to
address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based
on affective information. It accomplishes this by applying an emotion-aware LLM
to construct a retrieval database of affective embeddings. This database is
used by our retrieval module to obtain source-domain samples, which are
subsequently used for the inference module's in-context few-shot learning to
detect target domain misinformation. We evaluate our framework on three
misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant
improvements compared to the zero-shot method on three datasets, with the
highest increases of 20.69%, 23.94%, and 39.11% respectively. This work will be

"Despite the striking advances in recent language generation performance,
model-generated responses have suffered from the chronic problem of
hallucinations that are either untrue or unfaithful to a given source.
Especially in the task of knowledge grounded conversation, the models are
required to generate informative responses, but hallucinated utterances lead to
miscommunication. In particular, entity-level hallucination that causes
critical misinformation and undesirable conversation is one of the major
concerns. To address this issue, we propose a post-hoc refinement method called
REM. It aims to enhance the quality and faithfulness of hallucinated utterances
by refining them based on the source knowledge. If the generated utterance has
a low source-faithfulness score with the given knowledge, REM mines the key
entities in the knowledge and implicitly uses them for refining the utterances.
We verify that our method reduces entity hallucination in the utterance. Also,
we show the adaptability and efficacy of REM with extensive experiments and
generative results. Our code is available at https://github.com/YOONNAJANG/REM.","['Yoonna Jang', 'Suhyune Son', 'Jeongwoo Lee', 'Junyoung Son', 'Yuna Hur', 'Jungwoo Lim', 'Hyeonseok Moon', 'Kisu Yang', 'Heuiseok Lim']",6,0.5944716

RAFTS starts with evidence retrieval, where we design a retrieval pipeline to

forms contrastive arguments (i.e., supporting or refuting) conditioned on the
retrieved evidence. In addition, RAFTS leverages an embedding model to identify
informative demonstrations, followed by in-context prompting to generate the
prediction and explanation. Our method effectively retrieves relevant documents
as evidence and evaluates arguments from varying perspectives, incorporating
nuanced information for fine-grained decision-making. Combined with informative

"Malicious social bots achieve their malicious purposes by spreading
misinformation and inciting social public opinion, seriously endangering social
security, making their detection a critical concern. Recently, graph-based bot
detection methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However,

shown in Fig.1, which graph-based methods cannot effectively detect. To address
this problem, our research focuses on effectively utilizing node semantics and

user textual sequences, which is then used to perform supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) of the language model to improve its ability to understand social account
semantics. Next, the semantically enriched node representation is fed into the
pre-trained GNN to further enhance the node representation by aggregating
information from neighbors. Finally, LGB fuses the information from both
modalities to improve the detection performance of sparsely linked nodes.

biases embedded in Bot-authored misinformation and comparing them with their
counterparts, Human-authored misinformation. We complied a Misinfo Dataset that
contains COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation tweets annotated by author
identities, Bots vs Humans, from Twitter during the vaccination period from
July 2020 to July 2021. We developed an algorithm to computationally automate
the extraction of triggers for eight cognitive biase. Our analysis revealed
that the Availability Bias, Cognitive Dissonance, and Confirmation Bias were
most commonly present in misinformation, with Bot-authored tweets exhibiting a
greater prevalence, with distinct patterns in utilizing bias triggers between
Humans and Bots. We further linked these bias triggers with engagement metrics,
inferring their potential influence on tweet engagement and persuasiveness.
Overall, our findings indicate that bias-triggering tactics have been more
influential on Bot-authored tweets than Human-authored tweets. While certain

triggers unexpectedly decreased it. Conversely, triggers of most biases

"We consider the problem of recovering the ground truth ordering (ranking,
top-$k$, or others) over a large number of alternatives. The wisdom of crowd is
a heuristic approach based on Condorcet's Jury theorem to address this problem
through collective opinions. This approach fails to recover the ground truth
when the majority of the crowd is misinformed. The surprisingly popular (SP)
algorithm cite{prelec2017solution} is an alternative approach that is able to
recover the ground truth even when experts are in minority. The SP algorithm
requires the voters to predict other voters' report in the form of a full
probability distribution over all rankings of alternatives. However, when the
number of alternatives, $m$, is large, eliciting the prediction report or even
the vote over $m$ alternatives might be too costly. In this paper, we design a
scalable alternative of the SP algorithm which only requires eliciting partial
preferences from the voters, and propose new variants of the SP algorithm. In
particular, we propose two versions -- Aggregated-SP and Partial-SP -- that ask
voters to report vote and prediction on a subset of size $k$ ($\ll m$) in terms
of top alternative, partial rank, or an approval set. Through a large-scale
crowdsourcing experiment on MTurk, we show that both of our approaches
outperform conventional preference aggregation algorithms for the recovery of
ground truth rankings, when measured in terms of Kendall-Tau distance and
Spearman's $\rho$. We further analyze the collected data and demonstrate that
voters' behavior in the experiment, including the minority of the experts, and
the SP phenomenon, can be correctly simulated by a concentric mixtures of
Mallows model. Finally, we provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity
of SP algorithms with partial rankings to demonstrate the theoretical
guarantees of the proposed methods.","['Hadi Hosseini', 'Debmalya Mandal', 'Amrit Puhan']",2,0.6509434
"An infodemic refers to an enormous amount of true information and
misinformation disseminated during a disease outbreak. Detecting misinformation
at the early stage of an infodemic is key to manage it and reduce its harm to
public health. An early stage infodemic is characterized by a large volume of
unlabeled information concerning a disease. As a result, conventional
misinformation detection methods are not suitable for this misinformation
detection task because they rely on labeled information in the infodemic domain
to train their models. To address the limitation of conventional methods,
state-of-the-art methods learn their models using labeled information in other
domains to detect misinformation in the infodemic domain. The efficacy of these
methods depends on their ability to mitigate both covariate shift and concept
shift between the infodemic domain and the domains from which they leverage
labeled information. These methods focus on mitigating covariate shift but
overlook concept shift, rendering them less effective for the task. In
response, we theoretically show the necessity of tackling both covariate shift
and concept shift as well as how to operationalize each of them. Built on the
theoretical analysis, we develop a novel misinformation detection method that
addresses both covariate shift and concept shift. Using two real-world
datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the
superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art misinformation
detection methods as well as prevalent domain adaptation methods that can be
tailored to solve the misinformation detection task.","['Minjia Mao', 'Xiaohang Zhao', 'Xiao Fang']",0,0.65436375

responses to (mis)information about COVID-19 vaccines differed as a function of
prior attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines; (ii) participants exhibited a strong

"WhatsApp groups have become a hotbed for the propagation of harmful content

"With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various
domains, concerns regarding the trustworthiness of LLMs in safety-critical
scenarios have been raised, due to their unpredictable tendency to hallucinate
and generate misinformation. Existing LLMs do not have an inherent
functionality to provide the users with an uncertainty/confidence metric for
each response it generates, making it difficult to evaluate trustworthiness.
Although several studies aim to develop uncertainty quantification methods for
LLMs, they have fundamental limitations, such as being restricted to
classification tasks, requiring additional training and data, considering only
lexical instead of semantic information, and being prompt-wise but not
response-wise. A new framework is proposed in this paper to address these
issues. Semantic density extracts uncertainty/confidence information for each
response from a probability distribution perspective in semantic space. It has
no restriction on task types and is ""off-the-shelf"" for new models and tasks.

"Advances in generative AI (GenAI) have raised concerns about detecting and
discerning AI-generated content from human-generated content. Most existing
literature assumes a paradigm where 'expert' organized disinformation creators
and flawed AI models deceive 'ordinary' users. Based on longitudinal
ethnographic research with misinformation creators and consumers between
2022-2023, we instead find that GenAI supports bricolage work, where
non-experts increasingly use GenAI to remix, repackage, and (re)produce content
to meet their personal needs and desires. This research yielded four key
findings: First, participants primarily used GenAI for creation, rather than
truth-seeking. Second, a spreading 'influencer millionaire' narrative drove
participants to become content creators, using GenAI as a productivity tool to
generate a volume of (often misinformative) content. Third, GenAI lowered the
barrier to entry for content creation across modalities, enticing consumers to
become creators and significantly increasing existing creators' output.
Finally, participants used Gen AI to learn and deploy marketing tactics to
expand engagement and monetize their content. We argue for shifting analysis
from the public as consumers of AI content to bricoleurs who use GenAI
creatively, often without a detailed understanding of its underlying

platforms presents significant challenges to societal well-being, public trust,
and democratic processes, influencing critical decision making and public
opinion. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for automated
fake news detection mechanisms. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, prompting exploration into their potential for
verifying news claims. Instead of employing LLMs in a non-agentic way, where
LLMs generate responses based on direct prompts in a single shot, our work
introduces FactAgent, an agentic approach of utilizing LLMs for fake news
detection. FactAgent enables LLMs to emulate human expert behavior in verifying
news claims without any model training, following a structured workflow. This
workflow breaks down the complex task of news veracity checking into multiple
sub-steps, where LLMs complete simple tasks using their internal knowledge or
external tools. At the final step of the workflow, LLMs integrate all findings
throughout the workflow to determine the news claim's veracity. Compared to
manual human verification, FactAgent offers enhanced efficiency. Experimental
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FactAgent in verifying claims without
the need for any training process. Moreover, FactAgent provides transparent
explanations at each step of the workflow and during final decision-making,
offering insights into the reasoning process of fake news detection for end
users. FactAgent is highly adaptable, allowing for straightforward updates to
its tools that LLMs can leverage within the workflow, as well as updates to the
workflow itself using domain knowledge. This adaptability enables FactAgent's
application to news verification across various domains.","['Xinyi Li', 'Yongfeng Zhang', 'Edward C. Malthouse']",6,0.7637582
"Pollution of online social spaces caused by rampaging d/misinformation is a
growing societal concern. However, recent decisions to reduce access to social

user-generated content from Bluesky Social to address this pressing issue. The
dataset contains the complete post history of over 4M users (81% of all
registered accounts), totalling 235M posts. We also make available social data
covering follow, comment, repost, and quote interactions. Since Bluesky allows
users to create and bookmark feed generators (i.e., content recommendation
algorithms), we also release the full output of several popular algorithms
available on the platform, along with their timestamped ``like'' interactions

"Automated fact-checking (AFC) is garnering increasing attention by
researchers aiming to help fact-checkers combat the increasing spread of
misinformation online. While many existing AFC methods incorporate external
information from the Web to help examine the veracity of claims, they often
overlook the importance of verifying the source and quality of collected
""evidence"". One overlooked challenge involves the reliance on ""leaked
evidence"", information gathered directly from fact-checking websites and used
to train AFC systems, resulting in an unrealistic setting for early
misinformation detection. Similarly, the inclusion of information from
unreliable sources can undermine the effectiveness of AFC systems. To address
these challenges, we present a comprehensive approach to evidence verification
and filtering. We create the ""CREDible, Unreliable or LEaked"" (CREDULE)

and Fact checked (Leaked). Additionally, we introduce the EVidence VERification
Network (EVVER-Net), trained on CREDULE to detect leaked and unreliable
evidence in both short and long texts. EVVER-Net can be used to filter evidence
collected from the Web, thus enhancing the robustness of end-to-end AFC
systems. We experiment with various language models and show that EVVER-Net can
demonstrate impressive performance of up to 91.5% and 94.4% accuracy, while
leveraging domain credibility scores along with short or long texts,
respectively. Finally, we assess the evidence provided by widely-used

"In the battle against widespread online misinformation, a growing problem is
text-image inconsistency, where images are misleadingly paired with texts with
different intent or meaning. Existing classification-based methods for
text-image inconsistency can identify contextual inconsistencies but fail to
provide explainable justifications for their decisions that humans can
understand. Although more nuanced, human evaluation is impractical at scale and
susceptible to errors. To address these limitations, this study introduces
D-TIIL (Diffusion-based Text-Image Inconsistency Localization), which employs
text-to-image diffusion models to localize semantic inconsistencies in text and
image pairs. These models, trained on large-scale datasets act as ``omniscient""
agents that filter out irrelevant information and incorporate background
knowledge to identify inconsistencies. In addition, D-TIIL uses text embeddings
and modified image regions to visualize these inconsistencies. To evaluate
D-TIIL's efficacy, we introduce a new TIIL dataset containing 14K consistent
and inconsistent text-image pairs. Unlike existing datasets, TIIL enables
assessment at the level of individual words and image regions and is carefully
designed to represent various inconsistencies. D-TIIL offers a scalable and

"Detecting social bots has evolved into a pivotal yet intricate task, aimed at
combating the dissemination of misinformation and preserving the authenticity
of online interactions. While earlier graph-based approaches, which leverage
topological structure of social networks, yielded notable outcomes, they
overlooked the inherent dynamicity of social networks -- In reality, they
largely depicted the social network as a static graph and solely relied on its
most recent state. Due to the absence of dynamicity modeling, such approaches
are vulnerable to evasion, particularly when advanced social bots interact with
other users to camouflage identities and escape detection. To tackle these
challenges, we propose BotDGT, a novel framework that not only considers the
topological structure, but also effectively incorporates dynamic nature of

each historical snapshot. Additionally, a temporal module is proposed to
integrate historical context and model the evolving behavior patterns exhibited

"A significant amount of society's infrastructure can be modeled using graph
structures, from electric and communication grids, to traffic networks, to

spread of negative impacts, whether this be overloaded devices in the power
grid or the reach of a social media post containing misinformation. The
potential harm of a cascade is compounded when considering a malicious attack
by an adversary that is intended to maximize the cascading impact. However, by
exploiting knowledge of the cascading dynamics, targets with the largest
cascading impact can be preemptively prioritized for defense, and the damage an
adversary can inflict can be mitigated. While game theory provides tools for
finding an optimal preemptive defense strategy, existing methods struggle to
scale to the context of large graph environments because of the combinatorial
explosion of possible actions that occurs when the attacker and defender can
each choose multiple targets in the graph simultaneously. The proposed method
enables a data-driven deep learning approach that uses multi-node
representation learning and counterfactual data augmentation to generalize to
the full combinatorial action space by training on a variety of small
restricted subsets of the action space. We demonstrate through experiments that
the proposed method is capable of identifying defense strategies that are less
exploitable than SOTA methods for large graphs, while still being able to
produce strategies near the Nash equilibrium for small-scale scenarios for

"Community models for malicious content detection, which take into account the
context from a social graph alongside the content itself, have shown remarkable
performance on benchmark datasets. Yet, misinformation and hate speech continue
to propagate on social media networks. This mismatch can be partially
attributed to the limitations of current evaluation setups that neglect the
rapid evolution of online content and the underlying social graph. In this
paper, we propose a novel evaluation setup for model generalisation based on
our few-shot subgraph sampling approach. This setup tests for generalisation
through few labelled examples in local explorations of a larger graph,
emulating more realistic application settings. We show this to be a challenging
inductive setup, wherein strong performance on the training graph is not
indicative of performance on unseen tasks, domains, or graph structures.
Lastly, we show that graph meta-learners trained with our proposed few-shot
subgraph sampling outperform standard community models in the inductive setup.

"The use of words to convey speaker's intent is traditionally distinguished
from the `mention' of words for quoting what someone said, or pointing out
properties of a word. Here we show that computationally modeling this
use-mention distinction is crucial for dealing with counterspeech online.
Counterspeech that refutes problematic content often mentions harmful language
but is not harmful itself (e.g., calling a vaccine dangerous is not the same as
expressing disapproval of someone for calling vaccines dangerous). We show that
even recent language models fail at distinguishing use from mention, and that
this failure propagates to two key downstream tasks: misinformation and hate
speech detection, resulting in censorship of counterspeech. We introduce
prompting mitigations that teach the use-mention distinction, and show they
reduce these errors. Our work highlights the importance of the use-mention
distinction for NLP and CSS and offers ways to address it.","['Kristina Gligoric', 'Myra Cheng', 'Lucia Zheng', 'Esin Durmus', 'Dan Jurafsky']",8,0.51561266

"The proliferation of online misinformation has posed significant threats to
public interest. While numerous online users actively participate in the combat
against misinformation, many of such responses can be characterized by the lack
of politeness and supporting facts. As a solution, text generation approaches
are proposed to automatically produce counter-misinformation responses.
Nevertheless, existing methods are often trained end-to-end without leveraging
external knowledge, resulting in subpar text quality and excessively repetitive
responses. In this paper, we propose retrieval augmented response generation
for online misinformation (RARG), which collects supporting evidence from
scientific sources and generates counter-misinformation responses based on the
evidences. In particular, our RARG consists of two stages: (1) evidence

response generation, in which we align large language models (LLMs) to generate
evidence-based responses via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

refutations or supporting context, MUSE identifies and explains content
(in)accuracies with references. It conducts multimodal retrieval and interprets
visual content to verify and correct multimodal content. Given the absence of a
comprehensive evaluation approach, we propose 13 dimensions of misinformation
correction quality. Then, fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social
media content that are not presupposed to be misinformation but broadly include

demonstrate MUSE's ability to write high-quality responses to potential
misinformation--across modalities, tactics, domains, political leanings, and
for information that has not previously been fact-checked online--within
minutes of its appearance on social media. Overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by
37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%. Our work provides a

"Social media platforms have become one of the main channels where people
disseminate and acquire information, of which the reliability is severely
threatened by rumors widespread in the network. Existing approaches such as
suspending users or broadcasting real information to combat rumors are either
with high cost or disturbing users. In this paper, we introduce a novel rumor
mitigation paradigm, where only a minimal set of links in the social network
are intervened to decelerate the propagation of rumors, countering
misinformation with low business cost and user awareness. A knowledge-informed
agent embodying rumor propagation mechanisms is developed, which intervenes the
social network with a graph neural network for capturing information flow in
the social media platforms and a policy network for selecting links.
Experiments on real social media platforms demonstrate that the proposed
approach can effectively alleviate the influence of rumors, substantially
reducing the affected populations by over 25%. Codes for this paper are

the role of news publishers in potentially unintentionally propagating
misinformation, we examine how far-right and fringe online groups share and
leverage established legacy news media articles to advance their narratives.
Our findings suggest that online fringe ideologies spread through the use of
content that is consensus-based and ""factually correct"". We found that
Australian news publishers with both moderate and far-right political leanings
contain comparable levels of information completeness and quality; and
furthermore, that far-right Twitter users often share from moderate sources.
However, a stark difference emerges when we consider two additional factors: 1)
the narrow topic selection of articles by far-right users, suggesting that they
cherry pick only news articles that engage with their preexisting worldviews
and specific topics of concern, and 2) the difference between moderate and
far-right publishers when we examine the writing style of their articles.
Furthermore, we can identify users prone to sharing misinformation based on

response is instantiated as the reply that is written toward a
counter-misinformation message. Particularly, we first create a novel dataset

focused overview of this body of literature and proposes a unified formalism
that covers most of these forms. The goal is to underscore the similarities and
distinctions among various models, to motivate further research on the general
and universal properties of such models. We also highlight that while the path
for additional theoretical exploration appears clear, the empirical validation
of these models through data or experiments remains scant, with an unsettled
roadmap as of today. We therefore conclude with some perspectives aimed at

"Augmented generation techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) have revolutionized the field by enhancing
large language model (LLM) outputs with external knowledge and cached
information. However, the integration of vector databases, which serve as a
backbone for these augmentations, introduces critical challenges, particularly
in ensuring accurate vector matching. False vector matching in these databases
can significantly compromise the integrity and reliability of LLM outputs,
leading to misinformation or erroneous responses. Despite the crucial impact of
these issues, there is a notable research gap in methods to effectively detect
and address false vector matches in LLM-augmented generation. This paper
presents MeTMaP, a metamorphic testing framework developed to identify false
vector matching in LLM-augmented generation systems. We derive eight
metamorphic relations (MRs) from six NLP datasets, which form our method's
core, based on the idea that semantically similar texts should match and
dissimilar ones should not. MeTMaP uses these MRs to create sentence triplets
for testing, simulating real-world LLM scenarios. Our evaluation of MeTMaP over
203 vector matching configurations, involving 29 embedding models and 7
distance metrics, uncovers significant inaccuracies. The results, showing a
maximum accuracy of only 41.51\% on our tests compared to the original
datasets, emphasize the widespread issue of false matches in vector matching
methods and the critical need for effective detection and mitigation in
LLM-augmented applications.","['Guanyu Wang', 'Yuekang Li', 'Yi Liu', 'Gelei Deng', 'Tianlin Li', 'Guosheng Xu', 'Yang Liu', 'Haoyu Wang', 'Kailong Wang']",6,0.7491248
"Scientific facts are often spun in the popular press with the intent to
influence public opinion and action, as was evidenced during the COVID-19
pandemic. Automatic detection of misinformation in the scientific domain is
challenging because of the distinct styles of writing in these two media types
and is still in its nascence. Most research on the validity of scientific
reporting treats this problem as a claim verification challenge. In doing so,
significant expert human effort is required to generate appropriate claims. Our
solution bypasses this step and addresses a more real-world scenario where such
explicit, labeled claims may not be available. The central research question of
this paper is whether it is possible to use large language models (LLMs) to
detect misinformation in scientific reporting. To this end, we first present a
new labeled dataset SciNews, containing 2.4k scientific news stories drawn from
trusted and untrustworthy sources, paired with related abstracts from the
CORD-19 database. Our dataset includes both human-written and LLM-generated
news articles, making it more comprehensive in terms of capturing the growing
trend of using LLMs to generate popular press articles. Then, we identify
dimensions of scientific validity in science news articles and explore how this
can be integrated into the automated detection of scientific misinformation. We
propose several baseline architectures using LLMs to automatically detect false
representations of scientific findings in the popular press. For each of these
architectures, we use several prompt engineering strategies including
zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. We also test these
architectures and prompting strategies on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B,
Llama2-13B.","['Yupeng Cao', 'Aishwarya Muralidharan Nair', 'Elyon Eyimife', 'Nastaran Jamalipour Soofi', 'K. P. Subbalakshmi', 'John R. Wullert II', 'Chumki Basu', 'David Shallcross']",1,0.7020515
"Many deep learning synthetic speech generation tools are readily available.
The use of synthetic speech has caused financial fraud, impersonation of
people, and misinformation to spread. For this reason forensic methods that can
detect synthetic speech have been proposed. Existing methods often overfit on

synthetic speech detector that converts a time domain speech signal to a
mel-spectrogram and processes it in patches using a transformer neural network.
We evaluate the detection performance of PS3DT on ASVspoof2019 dataset. Our
experiments show that PS3DT performs well on ASVspoof2019 dataset compared to
other approaches using spectrogram for synthetic speech detection. We also
investigate generalization performance of PS3DT on In-the-Wild dataset. PS3DT
generalizes well than several existing methods on detecting synthetic speech

"Factual inconsistency with source documents in automatically generated

consistency(FC) metrics are constrained by their performance, efficiency, and
explainability. Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in text evaluation but their effectiveness in
assessing FC in summarisation remains underexplored. Prior research has mostly
focused on proprietary LLMs, leaving essential factors that affect their
assessment capabilities unexplored. Additionally, current FC evaluation
benchmarks are restricted to news articles, casting doubt on the generality of
the FC methods tested on them. In this paper, we first address the gap by
introducing TreatFact a dataset of LLM-generated summaries of clinical texts,

evaluation across news and clinical domains and analyse the impact of model
size, prompts, pre-training and fine-tuning data. Our findings reveal that
despite proprietary models prevailing on the task, open-source LLMs lag behind.
Nevertheless, there is potential for enhancing the performance of open-source
LLMs through increasing model size, expanding pre-training data, and developing

introduce a novel scenario where the attackers aim to covertly disseminate
targeted misinformation, such as hate speech or advertisement, through a
retrieval system. To achieve this, we propose a perilous backdoor attack
triggered by grammar errors in dense passage retrieval. Our approach ensures
that attacked models can function normally for standard queries but are
manipulated to return passages specified by the attacker when users
unintentionally make grammatical mistakes in their queries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our proposed

``infect'' other agents within a society of MLLMs. This infection leads to the
generation and circulation of harmful outputs, such as dangerous instructions
or misinformation, across the society. We also show the transferability of
these indirectly generated prompts, highlighting their possibility in
propagating malice through inter-agent communication. This research provides a
critical insight into a new dimension of threat posed by MLLMs, where a single
agent can act as a catalyst for widespread malevolent influence. Our work

detection, with a specific focus on the nuanced manipulation of narrative

"The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant
challenges for individuals and societies. Its increased credibility and broader
impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring
robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate

potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing
visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in
recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this

"Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with
subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as ""is aspartame linked
to cancer"". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large
range of websites and consider ""which, if any, of this evidence do I find
convincing?"". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In
particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial
queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different
facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to
authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity
and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM
predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance
of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that
humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or
is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the

"Machine-Generated Text (MGT) detection aims to identify a piece of text as
machine or human written. Prior work has primarily formulated MGT detection as
a binary classification task over an entire document, with limited work
exploring cases where only part of a document is machine generated. This paper
provides the first in-depth study of MGT that localizes the portions of a
document that were machine generated. Thus, if a bad actor were to change a key
portion of a news article to spread misinformation, whole document MGT
detection may fail since the vast majority is human written, but our approach
can succeed due to its granular approach. A key challenge in our MGT
localization task is that short spans of text, e.g., a single sentence,
provides little information indicating if it is machine generated due to its
short length. To address this, we leverage contextual information, where we
predict whether multiple sentences are machine or human written at once. This
enables our approach to identify changes in style or content to boost

"In the dynamic landscape of digital information, the rise of misinformation
and fake news presents a pressing challenge. This paper takes a completely new
approach to verifying news, inspired by how quantum actors can reach agreement
even when they are spatially spread out. We propose a radically new, to the
best of our knowledge, algorithm that uses quantum ``entanglement'' (think of
it as a special connection) to help news aggregators sniff out bad actors,
whether they be other news sources or even fact-checkers trying to spread
misinformation. This algorithm doesn't rely on quantum signatures, it just uses
basic quantum technology we already have, in particular, special pairs of
particles called ``EPR pairs'' that are much easier to create than other
options. More complex entangled states are like juggling too many balls -
they're hard to make and slow things down, especially when many players are
involved. For instance, bigger, more complex states like ``GHZ states'' work
for small groups, but they become messy with larger numbers. So, we stick with
Bell states, the simplest form of entanglement, which are easy to generate no
matter how many players are in the game. This means our algorithm is faster to
set up, works for any number of participants, and is more practical for
real-world use. Bonus points: it finishes in a fixed number of steps,
regardless of how many players are involved, making it even more scalable. This

enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks.
  In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer
configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to
adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing
offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and
21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation

both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of
14% and 26% in the respective tasks.
  The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating
pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces

"Social media platforms have diverse content moderation policies, with many

popular platform that starts enforcing content moderation rules may fear that
it could lose users to less-regulated alternative platforms. Moreover, if users

equilibrium, and evaluating the information quality available on each platform.
Applied to simple yet relevant social networks such as stochastic block models,

is designed to refuse to answer. Specifically, we investigate whether
in-context learning (ICL) can be used to re-learn forbidden tasks despite the
explicit fine-tuning of the model to refuse them. We first examine a toy
example of refusing sentiment classification to demonstrate the problem. Then,
we use ICL on a model fine-tuned to refuse to summarise made-up news articles.
Finally, we investigate whether ICL can undo safety training, which could

divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this
strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to
divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks
where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We
then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where
experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.","['Yizhou Zhang', 'Lun Du', 'Defu Cao', 'Qiang Fu', 'Yan Liu']",6,0.71900105

"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in generating textual responses from
visual inputs, but their versatility raises security concerns. This study takes
the first step in exposing VLMs' susceptibility to data poisoning attacks that
can manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We introduce
Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack where poison samples are visually
indistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcast
demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is a traditional
Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing
Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is a novel Persuasion Attack, leveraging
VLMs' text generation capabilities to craft persuasive and seemingly rational
narratives for misinformation, such as portraying junk food as healthy. We show
that Shadowcast effectively achieves the attacker's intentions using as few as
50 poison samples. Crucially, the poisoned samples demonstrate transferability
across different VLM architectures, posing a significant concern in black-box
settings. Moreover, Shadowcast remains potent under realistic conditions

"The results of information retrieval (IR) are usually presented in the form
of a ranked list of candidate documents, such as web search for humans and
retrieval-augmented generation for large language models (LLMs). List-aware
retrieval aims to capture the list-level contextual features to return a better
list, mainly including reranking and truncation. Reranking finely re-scores the
documents in the list. Truncation dynamically determines the cut-off point of
the ranked list to achieve the trade-off between overall relevance and avoiding
misinformation from irrelevant documents. Previous studies treat them as two
separate tasks and model them separately. However, the separation is not
optimal. First, it is hard to share the contextual information of the ranking
list between the two tasks. Second, the separate pipeline usually meets the
error accumulation problem, where the small error from the reranking stage can
largely affect the truncation stage. To solve these problems, we propose a
Reranking-Truncation joint model (GenRT) that can perform the two tasks
concurrently. GenRT integrates reranking and truncation via generative paradigm
based on encoder-decoder architecture. We also design the novel loss functions
for joint optimization to make the model learn both tasks. Sharing parameters
by the joint model is conducive to making full use of the common modeling
information of the two tasks. Besides, the two tasks are performed concurrently

"In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) intertwines with medical
research, the delineation of truth becomes increasingly complex. This study
ostensibly examines a purported novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, dubbed the Omega
variant, showcasing 31 unique mutations in the S gene region. However, the real
undercurrent of this narrative is a demonstration of the ease with which AI,
specifically ChatGPT-4, can fabricate convincing yet entirely fictional
scientific data. The so-called Omega variant was identified in a fully
vaccinated, previously infected 35-year-old male presenting with severe
COVID-19 symptoms. Through a detailed, albeit artificial, genomic analysis and
contact tracing, this study mirrors the rigorous methodology of genuine case
reports, thereby setting the stage for a compelling but entirely constructed

bases of data and accurate methodological approaches. This study contributes to
this expanding research landscape by employing network science methodologies
and entropic measures to analyze the behavioural patterns of social media users
sharing news pieces and dig into the diverse news consumption habits within
different online social media user groups. Our analyses reveal that users are
more inclined to share news classified as fake when they have previously posted
conspiracy or junk science content, and vice versa, creating a series of

disproportionately amplified, along with an influx of new anti-consensus user

"We develop a simulation framework for studying misinformation spread within
online social networks that blends agent-based modeling and natural language
processing techniques. While many other agent-based simulations exist in this
space, questions over their fidelity and generalization to existing networks in
part hinders their ability to provide actionable insights. To partially address
these concerns, we create a 'digital clone' of a known misinformation sharing
network by downloading social media histories for over ten thousand of its
users. We parse these histories to both extract the structure of the network
and model the nuanced ways in which information is shared and spread among its
members. Unlike many other agent-based methods in this space, information
sharing between users in our framework is sensitive to topic of discussion,
user preferences, and online community dynamics. To evaluate the fidelity of
our method, we seed our cloned network with a set of posts recorded in the base
network and compare propagation dynamics between the two, observing reasonable
agreement across the twin networks over a variety of metrics. Lastly, we
explore how the cloned network may serve as a flexible, low-cost testbed for
misinformation countermeasure evaluation and red teaming analysis. We hope the
tools explored here augment existing efforts in the space and unlock new
opportunities for misinformation countermeasure evaluation, a field that may
become increasingly important to consider with the anticipated rise of
misinformation campaigns fueled by generative artificial intelligence.","['Prateek Puri', 'Gabriel Hassler', 'Anton Shenk', 'Sai Katragadda']",2,0.73546827
"The increasing pervasiveness of fruitless disagreement poses a considerable
risk to social cohesion and constructive public discourse. While polarised
discussions can exhibit significant distrust in the news, it is still largely
unclear whether disagreement is somehow linked to misinformation. In this work,
we exploit the results of `Cartesio', an online experiment to rate the
trustworthiness of Italian news articles annotated for reliability by expert
evaluators. We developed a metric for disagreement that allows for correct
comparisons between news with different mean trust values. Our findings
indicate that, though misinformation receives lower trust ratings than accurate
information, it does not appear to be more controversial. Additionally, we
examined the relationship between these findings and Facebook user engagement
with news articles. Our results show that disagreement correlates with an
increased likelihood of commenting, probably linked to inconclusive and long
discussions. The emerging scenario is one in which fighting disinformation
seems ineffective in countering polarisation. Disagreement focuses more on the
divergence of opinions, trust, and their effects on social cohesion. This study
offers a foundation for unsupervised news item analysis independent of expert
annotation. Incorporating similar principles into the design of news
distribution platforms and social media systems can enhance online interactions

"Automated fact-checking has drawn considerable attention over the past few
decades due to the increase in the diffusion of misinformation on online
platforms. This is often carried out as a sequence of tasks comprising (i) the
detection of sentences circulating in online platforms which constitute claims
needing verification, followed by (ii) the verification process of those
claims. This survey focuses on the former, by discussing existing efforts
towards detecting claims needing fact-checking, with a particular focus on
multilingual data and methods. This is a challenging and fertile direction
where existing methods are yet far from matching human performance due to the
profoundly challenging nature of the issue. Especially, the dissemination of
information across multiple social platforms, articulated in multiple languages
and modalities demands more generalized solutions for combating misinformation.
Focusing on multilingual misinformation, we present a comprehensive survey of
existing multilingual claim detection research. We present state-of-the-art

"While auxiliary information has become a key to enhancing Large Language
Models (LLMs), relatively little is known about how LLMs merge these contexts,
specifically contexts generated by LLMs and those retrieved from external
sources. To investigate this, we formulate a systematic framework to identify
whether LLMs' responses are attributed to either generated or retrieved
contexts. To easily trace the origin of the response, we construct datasets
with conflicting contexts, i.e., each question is paired with both generated
and retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the correct answer. Our
experiments reveal a significant bias in several LLMs (GPT-4/3.5 and Llama2) to
favor generated contexts, even when they provide incorrect information. We
further identify two key factors contributing to this bias: i) contexts
generated by LLMs typically show greater similarity to the questions,
increasing their likelihood of being selected; ii) the segmentation process
used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness, thereby hindering their
full utilization in LLMs. Our analysis enhances the understanding of how LLMs
merge diverse contexts, offers valuable insights for advancing current LLM

"The rapid and widespread dissemination of misinformation through social
networks is a growing concern in today's digital age. This study focused on
modeling fake news diffusion, discovering the spreading dynamics, and designing
control strategies. A common approach for modeling the misinformation dynamics
is SIR-based models. Our approach is an extension of a model called 'SBFC'
which is a SIR-based model. This model has three states, Susceptible, Believer,
and Fact-Checker. The dynamics and transition between states are based on
neighbors' beliefs, hoax credibility, spreading rate, probability of verifying
the news, and probability of forgetting the current state. Our contribution is
to push this model to real social networks by considering different classes of
agents with their characteristics. We proposed two main strategies for
confronting misinformation diffusion. First, we can educate a minor class, like
scholars or influencers, to improve their ability to verify the news or
remember their state longer. The second strategy is adding fact-checker bots to
the network to spread the facts and influence their neighbors' states. Our
result shows that both of these approaches can effectively control the

contexts. This raises the concern that they can be used to deceive and
manipulate on unprecedented scales, for instance spreading political
misinformation on social media. In future, agentic AI systems might also
deceive and manipulate humans for their own ends. In this paper, first, I argue
that AI-generated content should be subject to stricter standards against
deception and manipulation than we ordinarily apply to humans. Second, I offer
new characterizations of AI deception and manipulation meant to support such
standards, according to which a statement is deceptive (manipulative) if it
leads human addressees away from the beliefs (choices) they would endorse under
``semi-ideal'' conditions. Third, I propose two measures to guard against AI
deception and manipulation, inspired by this characterization: ""extreme
transparency"" requirements for AI-generated content and defensive systems that,
among other things, annotate AI-generated statements with contextualizing
information. Finally, I consider to what extent these measures can protect
against deceptive behavior in future, agentic AIs, and argue that non-agentic
defensive systems can provide an important layer of defense even against more
powerful agentic systems.",['Christian Tarsney'],9,0.7548387
"In the age of the infodemic, it is crucial to have tools for effectively
monitoring the spread of rampant rumors that can quickly go viral, as well as
identifying vulnerable users who may be more susceptible to spreading such
misinformation. This proactive approach allows for timely preventive measures
to be taken, mitigating the negative impact of false information on society. We
propose a novel approach to predict viral rumors and vulnerable users using a
unified graph neural network model. We pre-train network-based user embeddings
and leverage a cross-attention mechanism between users and posts, together with
a community-enhanced vulnerability propagation (CVP) method to improve user and
propagation graph representations. Furthermore, we employ two multi-task
training strategies to mitigate negative transfer effects among tasks in
different settings, enhancing the overall performance of our approach. We also
construct two datasets with ground-truth annotations on information virality
and user vulnerability in rumor and non-rumor events, which are automatically
derived from existing rumor detection datasets. Extensive evaluation results of
our joint learning model confirm its superiority over strong baselines in all
three tasks: rumor detection, virality prediction, and user vulnerability
scoring. For instance, compared to the best baselines based on the Weibo
dataset, our model makes 3.8\% and 3.0\% improvements on Accuracy and MacF1 for
rumor detection, and reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 23.9\% and 16.5\% for
virality prediction and user vulnerability scoring, respectively. Our findings
suggest that our approach effectively captures the correlation between rumor
virality and user vulnerability, leveraging this information to improve
prediction performance and provide a valuable tool for infodemic surveillance.","['Xuan Zhang', 'Wei Gao']",2,0.7010571

"Engagement with misinformation on social media poses unprecedented threats to
societal well-being, particularly during health crises when susceptibility to
misinformation is heightened in a multi-topic context. This paper focuses on
the COVID-19 pandemic and addresses a critical gap in understanding online
engagement with multi-topic misinformation at two user levels: news sharers who
share source news items on social media and post viewers who engage with online
news posts. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 7273
fact-checked source news claims related to COVID-19 and their associated posts
on X, through the lens of topic diversity and conspiracy theories. We find that
false news, particularly when accompanied by conspiracy theories, exhibits
higher topic diversity than true news. At the news sharer level, false news has
a longer lifetime and receives more posts on X than true news. Additionally,
the integration of conspiracy theories is significantly associated with a
longer lifetime for COVID-19 misinformation. However, topic diversity has no
significant association with news sharer engagement in terms of news lifetime
and the number of posts. At the post viewer level, contrary to the news sharer
level, news posts characterized by heightened topic diversity receive more
reposts, likes, and replies. Notably, post viewers tend to engage more with
misinformation containing conspiracy narratives: false news posts that contain
conspiracy theories, on average, receive 40.8% more reposts, 45.2% more likes,
and 44.1% more replies compared to false news posts without conspiracy

their progression to ultraviolet divergence phenomena. In this process, we

unconsciously internalize these biases, which can persist even after they stop
using the programs. This study explores the cultural self-perception of LLMs by
prompting ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Bard (Google) with value questions derived from
the GLOBE project. The findings reveal that their cultural self-perception is
most closely aligned with the values of English-speaking countries and
countries characterized by sustained economic competitiveness. Recognizing the
cultural biases of LLMs and understanding how they work is crucial for all
members of society because one does not want the black box of artificial
intelligence to perpetuate bias in humans, who might, in turn, inadvertently
create and train even more biased algorithms.","['Wolfgang Messner', 'Tatum Greene', 'Josephine Matalone']",9,0.71276045
"This article presents a comparative analysis of the ability of two large
language model (LLM)-based chatbots, ChatGPT and Bing Chat, recently rebranded
to Microsoft Copilot, to detect veracity of political information. We use AI
auditing methodology to investigate how chatbots evaluate true, false, and
borderline statements on five topics: COVID-19, Russian aggression against
Ukraine, the Holocaust, climate change, and LGBTQ+ related debates. We compare
how the chatbots perform in high- and low-resource languages by using prompts
in English, Russian, and Ukrainian. Furthermore, we explore the ability of
chatbots to evaluate statements according to political communication concepts
of disinformation, misinformation, and conspiracy theory, using
definition-oriented prompts. We also systematically test how such evaluations
are influenced by source bias which we model by attributing specific claims to
various political and social actors. The results show high performance of
ChatGPT for the baseline veracity evaluation task, with 72 percent of the cases
evaluated correctly on average across languages without pre-training. Bing Chat
performed worse with a 67 percent accuracy. We observe significant disparities
in how chatbots evaluate prompts in high- and low-resource languages and how
they adapt their evaluations to political communication concepts with ChatGPT
providing more nuanced outputs than Bing Chat. Finally, we find that for some
veracity detection-related tasks, the performance of chatbots varied depending
on the topic of the statement or the source to which it is attributed. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-based chatbots in tackling different
forms of false information in online environments, but also points to the
substantial variation in terms of how such potential is realized due to
specific factors, such as language of the prompt or the topic.","['Elizaveta Kuznetsova', 'Mykola Makhortykh', 'Victoria Vziatysheva', 'Martha Stolze', 'Ani Baghumyan', 'Aleksandra Urman']",8,0.70236903
"In this work, we examine how fact-checkers prioritize which claims to
fact-check and what tools may assist them in their efforts. Through a series of
interviews with 23 professional fact-checkers from around the world, we
validate that harm assessment is a central component of how fact-checkers
triage their work. We also clarify the processes behind fact-checking
prioritization, finding that they are typically ad hoc, and gather suggestions
for tools that could help with these processes.
  To address the needs articulated by fact-checkers, we present a structured

"In the dynamic and rapidly evolving world of social media, detecting
anomalous users has become a crucial task to address malicious activities such
as misinformation and cyberbullying. As the increasing number of anomalous
users improves the ability to mimic normal users and evade detection, existing
methods only focusing on bot detection are ineffective in terms of capturing
subtle distinctions between users. To address these challenges, we proposed
SeGA, preference-aware self-contrastive learning for anomalous user detection,
which leverages heterogeneous entities and their relations in the Twittersphere
to detect anomalous users with different malicious strategies. SeGA utilizes
the knowledge of large language models to summarize user preferences via posts.
In addition, integrating user preferences with prompts as pseudo-labels for
preference-aware self-contrastive learning enables the model to learn
multifaceted aspects for describing the behaviors of users. Extensive
experiments on the proposed TwBNT benchmark demonstrate that SeGA significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (+3.5\% ~ 27.6\%) and empirically

discontent that their children are impressionable to misinformation, stating
that the burden falls on them to help their children develop critical thinking

"The importance of effective detection is underscored by the fact that
socialbots imitate human behavior to propagate misinformation, leading to an
ongoing competition between socialbots and detectors. Despite the rapid
advancement of reactive detectors, the exploration of adversarial socialbot
modeling remains incomplete, significantly hindering the development of
proactive detectors. To address this issue, we propose a mathematical
Structural Information principles-based Adversarial Socialbots Modeling
framework, namely SIASM, to enable more accurate and effective modeling of
adversarial behaviors. First, a heterogeneous graph is presented to integrate
various users and rich activities in the original social network and measure
its dynamic uncertainty as structural entropy. By minimizing the
high-dimensional structural entropy, a hierarchical community structure of the
social network is generated and referred to as the optimal encoding tree.
Secondly, a novel method is designed to quantify influence by utilizing the
assigned structural entropy, which helps reduce the computational cost of SIASM
by filtering out uninfluential users. Besides, a new conditional structural
entropy is defined between the socialbot and other users to guide the follower
selection for network influence maximization. Extensive and comparative
experiments on both homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks demonstrate
that, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed SIASM framework
yields substantial performance improvements in terms of network influence (up

EU to provide clear and specific information whenever they remove or restrict
access to certain content. These ""Statements of Reasons"" (SoRs) are collected
in the DSA Transparency Database to ensure transparency and scrutiny of content

empirically analyze 156 million SoRs within an observation period of two months
to provide an early look at content moderation decisions of social media
platforms in the EU. Our empirical analysis yields the following main findings:
(i) There are vast differences in the frequency of content moderation across
platforms. For instance, TikTok performs more than 350 times more content
moderation decisions per user than X/Twitter. (ii) Content moderation is most
commonly applied for text and videos, whereas images and other content formats
undergo moderation less frequently. (ii) The primary reasons for moderation
include content falling outside the platform's scope of service,
illegal/harmful speech, and pornography/sexualized content, with moderation of
misinformation being relatively uncommon. (iii) The majority of rule-breaking
content is detected and decided upon via automated means rather than manual
intervention. However, X/Twitter reports that it relies solely on non-automated
methods. (iv) There is significant variation in the content moderation actions
taken across platforms. Altogether, our study implies inconsistencies in how

"With the constant spread of misinformation on social media networks, a need
has arisen to continuously assess the veracity of digital content. This need
has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation
detection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information
available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to
train the models, specifically within the South African social media
environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of
knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This
research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South
African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African
misinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information
for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses
bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual
encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is
trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African
misinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the
training of the model increases model performance, in a South African
contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more
knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests
that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the
cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in
the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments.

"Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity
because of their comparable performance to proprietary LLMs. To efficiently

whether low-rank adapters can be exploited to control LLMs. To address this
gap, we demonstrate that an infected adapter can induce, on specific
triggers,an LLM to output content defined by an adversary and to even
maliciously use tools. To train a Trojan adapter, we propose two novel attacks,
POLISHED and FUSION, that improve over prior approaches. POLISHED uses a
superior LLM to align na\""ively poisoned data based on our insight that it can
better inject poisoning knowledge during training. In contrast, FUSION
leverages a novel over-poisoning procedure to transform a benign adapter into a
malicious one by magnifying the attention between trigger and target in model

that a compromised LLM agent can use malware to control the system (e.g., a

mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as

public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to
encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing
methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling
data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public

"The spread of fake news using out-of-context images has become widespread and
is a relevant problem in this era of information overload. Such out-of-context
fake news may arise across different domains like politics, sports,
entertainment, etc. In practical scenarios, an inherent problem of imbalance
exists among news articles from such widely varying domains, resulting in a few
domains with abundant data, while the rest containing very limited data. Under
such circumstances, it is imperative to develop methods which can work in such
varying amounts of data setting. In this work, we explore whether out-of-domain
data can help to improve out-of-context misinformation detection (termed here
as multi-modal fake news detection) of a desired domain, to address this
challenging problem. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework termed
DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt-tuning using Out-of-Domain data). First, to
compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to
extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and
corresponding text captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a
label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning
technique which leverages the training samples of all the available domains
based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale benchmark dataset, namely NewsCLIPpings
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state of-the-art performance,
significantly surpassing the existing approaches for this challenging task.

"Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is
potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images),
which accounts for higher ""credibility"" than text-only news pieces. Although
existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable
performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from
various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly
training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to
generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source
domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift
focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario
where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in
an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation
trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before
catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and
cross-modal approach (\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection.
It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and
visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the
semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module.
We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios
of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and
domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available).
Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets
(Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model. The

optimizing the timing of delivering accurate information, ensuring users
encounter it before receiving misinformation while minimizing the disruption to

model the propagation of misinformation, we frame optimal prebunking as a

enhance LLMs for both content and propagation-based misinformation detection.
These strategies boost LLMs to actively learn effective features from multiple

"Fears about the destabilizing impact of misinformation online have motivated
individuals and platforms to respond. Individuals have become empowered to
challenge others' online claims with fact-checks in pursuit of a healthier
information ecosystem and to break down echo chambers of self-reinforcing
opinion. Using Twitter data, here we show the consequences of individual
misinformation tagging: tagged posters had explored novel political information
and expanded topical interests immediately prior, but being tagged caused
posters to retreat into information bubbles. These unintended consequences were
softened by a collective verification system for misinformation moderation. In
Twitter's new platform, Community Notes, misinformation tagging was
peer-reviewed by other fact-checkers before exposure to the poster. With
collective misinformation tagging, posters were less likely to retreat from
diverse information engagement. Detailed comparison suggests differences in
toxicity, sentiment, readability, and delay in individual versus collective
misinformation tagging messages. These findings provide evidence for
differential impacts from individual versus collective moderation strategies on

"Continual learning algorithms are typically exposed to untrusted sources that
contain training data inserted by adversaries and bad actors. An adversary can
insert a small number of poisoned samples, such as mislabeled samples from
previously learned tasks, or intentional adversarial perturbed samples, into
the training datasets, which can drastically reduce the model's performance. In
this work, we demonstrate that continual learning systems can be manipulated by
malicious misinformation and present a new category of data poisoning attacks
specific for continual learners, which we refer to as {\em Poisoning Attacks
Against Continual Learners} (PACOL). The effectiveness of labeling flipping
attacks inspires PACOL; however, PACOL produces attack samples that do not
change the sample's label and produce an attack that causes catastrophic
forgetting. A comprehensive set of experiments shows the vulnerability of
commonly used generative replay and regularization-based continual learning
approaches against attack methods. We evaluate the ability of label-flipping

force the continual learning system to forget the knowledge of a learned

this by expanding negligence and product liability laws. Digital product
developers would be incentivized to mitigate potential algorithmic risks before

fact-checkers are crucial to debunking viral claims, they usually do not engage
in conversations on social media. Thereby, significant effort has been made to
automate the use of fact-checker material in social correction; however, no

"Susceptibility to misinformation describes the degree of belief in
unverifiable claims, a latent aspect of individuals' mental processes that is

we propose a computational approach to model users' latent susceptibility
levels. As shown in previous research, susceptibility is influenced by various
factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly
influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the
underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these
factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior.

alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational
modeling and human judgments, confirming the effectiveness of this latent

"The emergence of research focused to understand the spreading and impact of
disinformation is increasing year over year. Most times, the purpose of those
who start the spreading of information intentionally false and designed to
cause harm is in catalyzing its fast transformation into misinformation, which
is the false content shared by people who do not realize it is false or
misleading. Our interest is in discussing the role of people who decide to
adopt an active role in stopping the propagation of an information when they
realize that it is false. For this, we formulate two simple probabilistic
models to compare misinformation spreading in the possible scenarios for which
there is a passive or an active environment of aware individuals. With aware
individuals we mean those individuals who realize that a given information is
false or misleading. In the passive environment we assume that if one of an
aware individual is exposed to the misinformation then he/she will not spread
it. In the active environment we assume that if one of an aware individual is
exposed to the misinformation then he/she will not spread it but also he/she
will stop the propagation to other individuals from the individual who
contacted him/her. We appeal to the theory of branching processes to analyse
propagation in both scenarios and we discuss the role and the impact of
effective participation in stopping misinformation. We show that the
propagation reduces drastically provided we assume an active environment, and

"The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have
led to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional

factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as 'hallucinations.' These
errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate
misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a
time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In
this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human
labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We
leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent
works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by
measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model's
confidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables
straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than
supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses.

rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel
retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of

traceable gold knowledge. This knowledge base is separate from the LLM and
initially empty. It can be filled with validated knowledge and progressively
expanded. When an LLM encounters questions outside its domain, the system
recognizes its knowledge scope and determines whether it can answer the
question independently. Additionally, we introduce a method for automatically
and efficiently expanding the knowledge base of LLMs. Through qualitative and
quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the

"With the advent of social media, an increasing number of netizens are sharing
and reading posts and news online. However, the huge volumes of misinformation
(e.g., fake news and rumors) that flood the internet can adversely affect
people's lives, and have resulted in the emergence of rumor and fake news
detection as a hot research topic. The emotions and sentiments of netizens, as
expressed in social media posts and news, constitute important factors that can
help to distinguish fake news from genuine news and to understand the spread of
rumors. This article comprehensively reviews emotion-based methods for
misinformation detection. We begin by explaining the strong links between
emotions and misinformation. We subsequently provide a detailed analysis of a
range of misinformation detection methods that employ a variety of emotion,
sentiment and stance-based features, and describe their strengths and
weaknesses. Finally, we discuss a number of ongoing challenges in emotion-based
misinformation detection based on large language models and suggest future
research directions, including data collection (multi-platform, multilingual),

"The proliferation of harmful content and misinformation on social networks
necessitates content moderation policies to maintain platform health. One such
policy is shadow banning, which limits content visibility. The danger of shadow
banning is that it can be misused by social media platforms to manipulate
opinions. Here we present an optimization based approach to shadow banning that
can shape opinions into a desired distribution and scale to large networks.
Simulations on real network topologies show that our shadow banning policies
can shift opinions and increase or decrease opinion polarization. We find that
if one shadow bans with the aim of shifting opinions in a certain direction,
the resulting shadow banning policy can appear neutral. This shows the
potential for social media platforms to misuse shadow banning without being
detected. Our results demonstrate the power and danger of shadow banning for
opinion manipulation in social networks.","['Yen-Shao Chen', 'Tauhid Zaman']",3,0.5011289
"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various tasks. However, their suitability for domain-specific tasks, is limited
due to their immense scale at deployment, susceptibility to misinformation, and
more importantly, high data annotation costs. We propose a novel Interactive
Multi-Fidelity Learning (IMFL) framework for the cost-effective development of
small domain-specific LMs under limited annotation budgets. Our approach
formulates the domain-specific fine-tuning process as a multi-fidelity learning
problem, focusing on identifying the optimal acquisition strategy that balances
between low-fidelity automatic LLM annotations and high-fidelity human
annotations to maximize model performance. We further propose an
exploration-exploitation query strategy that enhances annotation diversity and
informativeness, incorporating two innovative designs: 1) prompt retrieval that
selects in-context examples from human-annotated samples to improve LLM
annotation, and 2) variable batch size that controls the order for choosing
each fidelity to facilitate knowledge distillation, ultimately enhancing
annotation quality. Extensive experiments on financial and medical tasks
demonstrate that IMFL achieves superior performance compared with single
fidelity annotations. Given a limited budget of human annotation, IMFL
significantly outperforms the human annotation baselines in all four tasks and
achieves very close performance as human annotations on two of the tasks. These
promising results suggest that the high human annotation costs in
domain-specific tasks can be significantly reduced by employing IMFL, which
utilizes fewer human annotations, supplemented with cheaper and faster LLM
(e.g., GPT-3.5) annotations to achieve comparable performance.","['Jiaxin Zhang', 'Zhuohang Li', 'Kamalika Das', 'Sricharan Kumar']",6,0.69313115
"A significant increase in content creation and information exchange has been
made possible by the quick development of online social media platforms, which

"Conspiracy theories, as a type of misinformation, are narratives that
explains an event or situation in an irrational or malicious manner. While most
previous work examined conspiracy theory in social media short texts, limited
attention was put on such misinformation in long news documents. In this paper,
we aim to identify whether a news article contains conspiracy theories. We
observe that a conspiracy story can be made up by mixing uncorrelated events
together, or by presenting an unusual distribution of relations between events.
Achieving a contextualized understanding of events in a story is essential for
detecting conspiracy theories. Thus, we propose to incorporate an event
relation graph for each article, in which events are nodes, and four common
types of event relations, coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent
relations, are considered as edges. Then, we integrate the event relation graph
into conspiracy theory identification in two ways: an event-aware language
model is developed to augment the basic language model with the knowledge of
events and event relations via soft labels; further, a heterogeneous graph
attention network is designed to derive a graph embedding based on hard labels.
Experiments on a large benchmark dataset show that our approach based on event
relation graph improves both precision and recall of conspiracy theory
identification, and generalizes well for new unseen media sources.","['Yuanyuan Lei', 'Ruihong Huang']",3,0.6091387
"The amount of news being consumed online has substantially expanded in recent
years. Fake news has become increasingly common, especially in regional
languages like Malayalam, due to the rapid publication and lack of editorial
standards on some online sites. Fake news may have a terrible effect on

even engage in violent behavior. When we take into the context of India, there
are many regional languages, and fake news is spreading in every language.
Therefore, providing efficient techniques for identifying false information in
regional tongues is crucial. Until now, little to no work has been done in
Malayalam, extracting features from multiple modalities to classify fake news.
Multimodal approaches are more accurate in detecting fake news, as features

"Misinformation and disinformation are growing threats in the digital age,
spreading rapidly across languages and borders. This paper investigates the
prevalence and dynamics of multilingual misinformation through an analysis of
over 250,000 unique fact-checks spanning 95 languages. First, we find that
while the majority of misinformation claims are only fact-checked once, 11.7%,
corresponding to more than 21,000 claims, are checked multiple times. Using
fact-checks as a proxy for the spread of misinformation, we find 33% of
repeated claims cross linguistic boundaries, suggesting that some
misinformation permeates language barriers. However, spreading patterns exhibit
strong homophily, with misinformation more likely to spread within the same
language. To study the evolution of claims over time and mutations across
languages, we represent fact-checks with multilingual sentence embeddings and
cluster semantically similar claims. We analyze the connected components and
shortest paths connecting different versions of a claim finding that claims
gradually drift over time and undergo greater alteration when traversing
languages. Overall, this novel investigation of multilingual misinformation
provides key insights. It quantifies redundant fact-checking efforts,
establishes that some claims diffuse across languages, measures linguistic
homophily, and models the temporal and cross-lingual evolution of claims. The
findings advocate for expanded information sharing between fact-checkers

"The malicious applications of deep forgery, represented by face swapping,
have introduced security threats such as misinformation dissemination and

methods to trace the copyright of facial images for post-event traceability,
these methods cannot effectively prevent the generation of forgeries at the
source and curb their dissemination. To address this problem, we propose a
novel comprehensive active defense mechanism that combines traceability and
adversariality, called Dual Defense. Dual Defense invisibly embeds a single
robust watermark within the target face to actively respond to sudden cases of
malicious face swapping. It disrupts the output of the face swapping model
while maintaining the integrity of watermark information throughout the entire

embedding network based on original-domain feature impersonation attack. This
network learns robust adversarial features of target facial images and embeds
watermarks, seeking a well-balanced trade-off between watermark invisibility,
adversariality, and traceability through perceptual adversarial encoding
strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dual Defense achieves
optimal overall defense success rates and exhibits promising universality in
anti-face swapping tasks and dataset generalization ability. It maintains

might be less sensitive to document-level inference and show OpenLLaMA-3B to be
approximately as sensitive as OpenLLaMA-7B to our approach. Finally, we
consider two mitigation strategies and find the AUC to slowly decrease when
only partial documents are considered but to remain fairly high when the model
precision is reduced. Taken together, our results show that accurate

"AI-generated text has proliferated across various online platforms, offering
both transformative prospects and posing significant risks related to
misinformation and manipulation. Addressing these challenges, this paper
introduces SAID (Social media AI Detection), a novel benchmark developed to
assess AI-text detection models' capabilities in real social media platforms.
It incorporates real AI-generate text from popular social media platforms like
Zhihu and Quora. Unlike existing benchmarks, SAID deals with content that
reflects the sophisticated strategies employed by real AI users on the Internet
which may evade detection or gain visibility, providing a more realistic and
challenging evaluation landscape. A notable finding of our study, based on the
Zhihu dataset, reveals that annotators can distinguish between AI-generated and
human-generated texts with an average accuracy rate of 96.5%. This finding
necessitates a re-evaluation of human capability in recognizing AI-generated
text in today's widely AI-influenced environment. Furthermore, we present a new
user-oriented AI-text detection challenge focusing on the practicality and
effectiveness of identifying AI-generated text based on user information and
multiple responses. The experimental results demonstrate that conducting
detection tasks on actual social media platforms proves to be more challenging
compared to traditional simulated AI-text detection, resulting in a decreased
accuracy. On the other hand, user-oriented AI-generated text detection
significantly improve the accuracy of detection.","['Wanyun Cui', 'Linqiu Zhang', 'Qianle Wang', 'Shuyang Cai']",9,0.7619059
"Fact-checking is a crucial task as it ensures the prevention of
misinformation. However, manual fact-checking cannot keep up with the rate at
which false information is generated and disseminated online. Automated
fact-checking by machines is significantly quicker than by humans. But for
better trust and transparency of these automated systems, explainability in the
fact-checking process is necessary. Fact-checking often entails contrasting a
factual assertion with a body of knowledge for such explanations. An effective
way of representing knowledge is the Knowledge Graph (KG). There have been
sufficient works proposed related to fact-checking with the usage of KG but not
much focus is given to the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in such
cases. To mitigate this gap, we propose an RL-based KG reasoning approach for
explainable fact-checking. Extensive experiments on FB15K-277 and NELL-995
datasets reveal that reasoning over a KG is an effective way of producing
human-readable explanations in the form of paths and classifications for fact
claims. The RL reasoning agent computes a path that either proves or disproves
a factual claim, but does not provide a verdict itself. A verdict is reached by
a voting mechanism that utilizes paths produced by the agent. These paths can
be presented to human readers so that they themselves can decide whether or not
the provided evidence is convincing or not. This work will encourage works in
this direction for incorporating RL for explainable fact-checking as it
increases trustworthiness by providing a human-in-the-loop approach.","['Gustav Nikopensius', 'Mohit Mayank', 'Orchid Chetia Phukan', 'Rajesh Sharma']",1,0.71705866

"Persuasion is the process of changing an agent's belief distribution from a
given (or estimated) prior to a desired posterior. A common assumption in the
acceptance of information or misinformation as fact is that the
(mis)information must be consistent with or familiar to the individual who
accepts it. We model the process as a control problem in which the state is
given by a (time-varying) belief distribution following a predictor-corrector
dynamic. Persuasion is modeled as the corrector control signal with the
performance index defined using the Fisher-Rao information metric, reflecting a
fundamental cost associated to altering the agent's belief distribution. To
compensate for the fact that information production arises naturally from the
predictor dynamic (i.e., expected beliefs change) we modify the Fisher-Rao
metric to account just for information generated by the control signal. The
resulting optimal control problem produces non-geodesic paths through
distribution space that are compared to the geodesic paths found using the
standard free entropy minimizing Fisher metric in several example belief
models: a Kalman Filter, a Boltzmann distribution and a joint Kalman/Boltzmann
belief system.","['Geoff Goehle', 'Christopher Griffin']",2,0.6936928

"Shortly after the first COVID-19 cases became apparent in December 2020,
rumors spread on social media suggesting a connection between the virus and the
5G radiation emanating from the recently deployed telecommunications network.
In the course of the following weeks, this idea gained increasing popularity,
and various alleged explanations for how such a connection manifests emerged.
Ultimately, after being amplified by prominent conspiracy theorists, a series

kidnapping of telecommunication technicians in Peru. In this paper, we study
the spread of content related to a conspiracy theory with harmful consequences,
a so-called digital wildfire. In particular, we investigate the 5G and COVID-19

May 2020. For this purpose, we examine the community dynamics in complex
temporal interaction networks underlying Twitter user activity. We assess the
evolution of such digital wildfires by appropriately defining the temporal
dynamics of communication in communities within social networks. We show that,
for this specific misinformation event, the number of interactions of the users
participating in a digital wildfire, as well as the size of the engaged
communities, both follow a power-law distribution. Moreover, our research
elucidates the possibility of quantifying the phases of a digital wildfire, as

"Claim verification plays a crucial role in combating misinformation. While
existing works on claim verification have shown promising results, a crucial
piece of the puzzle that remains unsolved is to understand how to verify claims
without relying on human-annotated data, which is expensive to create at a
large scale. Additionally, it is important for models to provide comprehensive
explanations that can justify their decisions and assist human fact-checkers.
This paper presents First-Order-Logic-Guided Knowledge-Grounded (FOLK)
Reasoning that can verify complex claims and generate explanations without the
need for annotated evidence using Large Language Models (LLMs). FOLK leverages
the in-context learning ability of LLMs to translate the claim into a
First-Order-Logic (FOL) clause consisting of predicates, each corresponding to
a sub-claim that needs to be verified. Then, FOLK performs FOL-Guided reasoning
over a set of knowledge-grounded question-and-answer pairs to make veracity
predictions and generate explanations to justify its decision-making process.
This process makes our model highly explanatory, providing clear explanations
of its reasoning process in human-readable form. Our experiment results

"Epidemic models study the spread of an undesired agent through a population,
be it infectious diseases through a country, misinformation in online social
media, or pests infesting a region. In combating these epidemics, we rely
neither on global top-down interventions, nor solely on individual adaptations.
Instead, interventions most commonly come from local institutions such as
public health departments, moderation teams on social media platforms, or other
forms of group governance. Classic models, which are often individual or
agent-based, are ill-suited to capture local adaptations. We leverage recent
development of institutional dynamics based on cultural group selection to
study how groups can attempt local control of an epidemic by taking inspiration
from the successes and failures of other groups. Incorporating these
institutional changes into the epidemic dynamics reveals paradoxes: a higher
transmission rate can result in smaller outbreaks and decreasing the speed of
institutional adaptation generally reduces outbreak size. When groups perceive
a contagion as more worrisome, they can invest in improved policies and, if
they maintain these policies long enough to have impact, lead to a reduction in
endemicity. By looking at the interplay between the speed of institutions and
the transmission rate of the contagions, we find rich co-evolutionary dynamics

"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have brought remarkable
success in the field of LLM-as-Agent. Nevertheless, a prevalent assumption is
that the information processed by LLMs is consistently honest, neglecting the
pervasive deceptive or misleading information in human society and AI-generated

potentially resulting in detrimental outcomes. This study utilizes the
intricate Avalon game as a testbed to explore LLMs' potential in deceptive

manifests as a ""Game-of-Thoughts"". Inspired by the efficacy of humans'
recursive thinking and perspective-taking in the Avalon game, we introduce a

refinement contemplation processes; formulation contemplation produces initial
thoughts and speech, while refinement contemplation further polishes them.
Additionally, we incorporate first-order and second-order perspective
transitions into these processes respectively. Specifically, the first-order
allows an LLM agent to infer others' mental states, and the second-order
involves understanding how others perceive the agent's mental state. After
integrating ReCon with different LLMs, extensive experiment results from the
Avalon game indicate its efficacy in aiding LLMs to discern and maneuver around

$(k,\Delta)$-core decomposition is an edge-based decomposition founded on the
new notion of $\Delta$-degree. The $\Delta$-degree of an edge is defined as the
minimum number of edges incident to one of its endpoints that have a temporal
distance of at most~$\Delta$. Moreover, we define a new notion of temporal
connectedness leading to an efficiently computable equivalence relation between
so-called $\Delta$-connected components of the temporal network. We provide
efficient algorithms for the $(k,\Delta)$-core decomposition and
$\Delta$-connectedness, and apply them to solve community search problems,
where we are given a query node and want to find a densely connected community
containing the query node. Such a community is an edge-induced temporal
subgraph representing densely connected groups of nodes with frequent
interactions, which also captures changes over time. We provide an efficient
algorithm for community search for the case without restricting the number of
nodes. If the number of nodes is restricted, we show that the decision version
is NP-complete. In our evaluation, we show how in a real-world social network,
the inner $(k,\Delta)$-cores contain only the spreading of misinformation and
that the $\Delta$-connected components of the cores are highly edge-homophilic,
i.e., the majorities of the edges in the $\Delta$-connected components
represent either misinformation or fact-checking. Moreover, we demonstrate how
our algorithms for $\Delta$-community search successfully and efficiently
identify informative structures in collaboration networks.","['Lutz Oettershagen', 'Athanasios L. Konstantinidis', 'Giuseppe F. Italiano']",2,0.65423703

"Users rely on search engines for information in critical contexts, such as
public health emergencies. Understanding how users evaluate the trustworthiness
of search results is therefore essential. Research has identified rank and the
presence of misinformation as factors impacting perceptions and click behavior
in search. Here, we elaborate on these findings by measuring the effects of
rank and misinformation, as well as warning banners, on the perceived
trustworthiness of individual results in search. We conducted three online
experiments (N=3196) using Covid-19-related queries to address this question.
We show that although higher-ranked results are clicked more often, they are
not more trusted. We also show that misinformation did not change trust in
accurate results below it. However, a warning about unreliable sources
backfired, decreasing trust in accurate information but not misinformation.

system these LLMs are, and the sort of cognitive systems human beings are. It
is found that many of the practical weaknesses of these AI systems can be tied
specifically to lacks in the basic cognitive architectures according to which
these systems are built. It is argued that incremental improvement of such LLMs
is not a viable approach to working toward human-level AGI, in practical terms

"Detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM^4) has become
increasingly crucial due to the widespread dissemination of face forgery and
text misinformation. In this paper, we present the Unified Frequency-Assisted
transFormer framework, named UFAFormer, to address the DGM^4 problem. Unlike
previous state-of-the-art methods that solely focus on the image (RGB) domain
to describe visual forgery features, we additionally introduce the frequency
domain as a complementary viewpoint. By leveraging the discrete wavelet
transform, we decompose images into several frequency sub-bands, capturing rich
face forgery artifacts. Then, our proposed frequency encoder, incorporating
intra-band and inter-band self-attentions, explicitly aggregates forgery
features within and across diverse sub-bands. Moreover, to address the semantic
conflicts between image and frequency domains, the forgery-aware mutual module
is developed to further enable the effective interaction of disparate image and
frequency features, resulting in aligned and comprehensive visual forgery
representations. Finally, based on visual and textual forgery features, we
propose a unified decoder that comprises two symmetric cross-modal interaction
modules responsible for gathering modality-specific forgery information, along
with a fusing interaction module for aggregation of both modalities. The
proposed unified decoder formulates our UFAFormer as a unified framework,
ultimately simplifying the overall architecture and facilitating the
optimization process. Experimental results on the DGM^4 dataset, containing

"The expansion of online social media platforms has led to a surge in online
content consumption. However, this has also paved the way for disseminating
false claims and misinformation. As a result, there is an escalating demand for
a substantial workforce to sift through and validate such unverified claims.
Currently, these claims are manually verified by fact-checkers. Still, the
volume of online content often outweighs their potency, making it difficult for
them to validate every single claim in a timely manner. Thus, it is critical to
determine which assertions are worth fact-checking and prioritize claims that
require immediate attention. Multiple factors contribute to determining whether
a claim necessitates fact-checking, encompassing factors such as its factual
correctness, potential impact on the public, the probability of inciting
hatred, and more. Despite several efforts to address claim check-worthiness, a
systematic approach to identify these factors remains an open challenge. To
this end, we introduce a new task of fine-grained claim check-worthiness, which
underpins all of these factors and provides probable human grounds for
identifying a claim as check-worthy. We present CheckIt, a manually annotated
large Twitter dataset for fine-grained claim check-worthiness. We benchmark our

Therefore, technologies that can detect and assess the integrity of digital

channels denoting the type and content of tweets posted by the users. Firstly,
we create digital DNA sequences, transform them to 3d images, and apply
pretrained models of the vision domain, including EfficientNet, AlexNet, VGG16,

getting the textual representation of the user description field and employ
VGG16 for acquiring the visual representation for the image modality. We
propose three different fusion methods, namely concatenation, gated multimodal
unit, and crossmodal attention, for fusing the different modalities and compare
their performances. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis of the behavior
of our best performing model. Extensive experiments conducted on the Cresci'17

"The proliferation of misinformation has emerged as a new form of warfare in
the information age. This type of warfare involves cyberwarriors, who
deliberately propagate messages aimed at defaming opponents or fostering unity
among allies. In this study, we investigate the level of activity exhibited by
cyberwarriors within a large online forum, and remarkably, we discover that
only a minute fraction of cyberwarriors are active users. Surprisingly, despite
their expected role of actively disseminating misinformation, cyberwarriors
remain predominantly silent during peacetime and only spring into action when
necessary. Moreover, we analyze the challenges associated with identifying
cyberwarriors and provide evidence that detecting inactive cyberwarriors is
considerably more challenging than identifying their active counterparts.

"Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are
crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However,
achieving this goal is non-trivial, mainly because assessing the blocked
influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive
Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). Although several approaches have been proposed
to enhance efficiency, they still fail to achieve real-time solutions to IBM
problems of practical scales. This work presents a novel approach that enables
solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds.
The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model, called neural
influence estimator (NIE), as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs. To this
end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the
false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the
topology and inter-relationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked
influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems
defined on a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM
optimization algorithms such as the greedy algorithm. The experiments on 25 IBM
problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization
method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based
optimization method to achieve the same solution quality. Moreover, given a
real-time constraint of one minute, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems
with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of
magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.","['Wenjie Chen', 'Shengcai Liu', 'Yew-Soon Ong', 'Ke Tang']",2,0.64981985

machine learning to trust and safety problems, using misinformation detection
as a case study. We survey literature on automated detection of misinformation

"AI-generated images have become increasingly realistic and have garnered
significant public attention. While synthetic images are intriguing due to
their realism, they also pose an important misinformation threat. To address
this new threat, researchers have developed multiple algorithms to detect
synthetic images and identify their source generators. However, most existing
source attribution techniques are designed to operate in a closed-set scenario,
i.e. they can only be used to discriminate between known image generators. By
contrast, new image-generation techniques are rapidly emerging. To contend with
this, there is a great need for open-set source attribution techniques that can
identify when synthetic images have originated from new, unseen generators. To
address this problem, we propose a new metric learning-based approach. Our
technique works by learning transferrable embeddings capable of discriminating
between generators, even when they are not seen during training. An image is
first assigned to a candidate generator, then is accepted or rejected based on
its distance in the embedding space from known generators' learned reference
points. Importantly, we identify that initializing our source attribution
embedding network by pretraining it on image camera identification can improve
our embeddings' transferability. Through a series of experiments, we
demonstrate our approach's ability to attribute the source of synthetic images
in open-set scenarios.","['Shengbang Fang', 'Tai D. Nguyen', 'Matthew C. Stamm']",7,0.8116881
"Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its
implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information

impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with
fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here, we
investigate the impact of fact-checking information generated by a popular
large language model (LLM) on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news
headlines in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the LLM
accurately identifies most false headlines (90%), we find that this information
does not significantly improve participants' ability to discern headline

checks enhances discernment in both cases. Subsequent analysis reveals that the
AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: it decreases beliefs in true
headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs in false headlines
that it is unsure about. On the positive side, AI fact-checking information
increases the sharing intent for correctly labeled true headlines. When

"With the explosion of multimedia content, video moment retrieval (VMR), which

"We present a new framework to conceptualize and operationalize the total user
experience of search, by studying the entirety of a search journey from an
utilitarian point of view.
  Web search engines are widely perceived as ""free"". But search requires time
and effort: in reality there are many intermingled non-monetary costs (e.g.
time costs, cognitive costs, interactivity costs) and the benefits may be
marred by various impairments, such as misunderstanding and misinformation.
This characterization of costs and benefits appears to be inherent to the human
search for information within the pursuit of some larger task: most of the
costs and impairments can be identified in interactions with any web search
engine, interactions with public libraries, and even in interactions with
ancient oracles. To emphasize this innate connection, we call these costs and
benefits Delphic, in contrast to explicitly financial costs and benefits.
  Our main thesis is that the users' satisfaction with a search engine mostly
depends on their experience of Delphic cost and benefits, in other words on
their utility. The consumer utility is correlated with classic measures of
search engine quality, such as ranking, precision, recall, etc., but is not
completely determined by them. To argue our thesis, we catalog the Delphic
costs and benefits and show how the development of search engines over the last

Large Language Models, was driven to a great extent by the quest of decreasing
Delphic costs and increasing Delphic benefits.

"Most prior and current research examining misinformation spread on social

fail to capture another potential form of misinformation with a much larger
audience: factual news from mainstream sources ('real' news) repurposed to

existing unsupervised NLP technique and examine the narratives present in
misinformation content. We find that certain articles from reliable outlets are
shared by a disproportionate number of users who also shared fake news on
Twitter. We consider these 'real' news articles to be co-shared with fake news.
We show that co-shared articles contain existing misinformation narratives at a
significantly higher rate than articles from the same reliable outlets that are
not co-shared with fake news. This holds true even when articles are chosen
following strict criteria of reliability for the outlets and after accounting
for the alternative explanation of partisan curation of articles. For example,

"An accurate and timely estimate of the reproduction ratio R of an infectious
disease epidemic is crucial to make projections on its evolution and set up the
appropriate public health response. Estimates of R routinely come from
statistical inference on timelines of cases or their proxies like symptomatic
cases, hospitalizatons, deaths. Here, however, we prove that these estimates of
R may not be accurate if the population is made up of spatially distinct
communities, as the interplay between space and mobility may hide the true
epidemic evolution from surveillance data. This means that surveillance may
underestimate R over long periods, to the point of mistaking a growing epidemic
for a subsiding one, misinforming public health response. To overcome this, we
propose a correction to be applied to surveillance data that removes this bias
and ensures an accurate estimate of R across all epidemic phases. We use
COVID-19 as case study; our results, however, apply to any epidemic where
mobility is a driver of circulation, including major challenges of the next
decades: respiratory infections (influenza, SARS-CoV-2, emerging pathogens),
vector-borne diseases (arboviruses). Our findings will help set up public

"The proliferation of misinformation and propaganda is a global challenge,
with profound effects during major crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the
Russian invasion of Ukraine. Understanding the spread of misinformation and its
social impacts requires identifying the news sources spreading false
information. While machine learning (ML) techniques have been proposed to
address this issue, ML models have failed to provide an efficient
implementation scenario that yields useful results. In prior research, the
precision of deployment in real traffic deteriorates significantly,
experiencing a decrement up to ten times compared to the results derived from
benchmark data sets. Our research addresses this gap by proposing a graph-based
approach to capture navigational patterns and generate traffic-based features
which are used to train a classification model. These navigational and
traffic-based features result in classifiers that present outstanding
performance when evaluated against real traffic. Moreover, we also propose
graph-based filtering techniques to filter out models to be classified by our
framework. These filtering techniques increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the
models to be classified, greatly reducing false positives and the computational
cost of deploying the model. Our proposed framework for the detection of
misinformation domains achieves a precision of 0.78 when evaluated in real

conventional video classification task into a text classification task by
leveraging the textual content derived from the video transcripts. We employ
advanced machine learning techniques like transfer learning to solve the

these datasets, we evaluated the models distinguishing valid information from

great promise for education technology, and in this paper we look specifically
at the potential for incorporating large language models in AI-driven language

opening up routes toward content generation which had not previously been
plausible. For text generation they must be prompted carefully and their
outputs may need to be reshaped before they are ready for use. For automated
grading and grammatical error correction, tasks whose progress is checked on
well-known benchmarks, early investigations indicate that large language models
on their own do not improve on state-of-the-art results according to standard
evaluation metrics. For grading it appears that linguistic features established
in the literature should still be used for best performance, and for error
correction it may be that the models can offer alternative feedback styles
which are not measured sensitively with existing methods. In all cases, there

reliability-sensitive scenarios, potentially hindering real-world adoptions.
While uncertainty estimation has shown its potential for interpreting the

"Developing interventions that successfully reduce engagement with

that allows users to write textual notes to inform others about potentially
misleading posts on X/Twitter. Yet, empirical evidence regarding its
effectiveness in reducing engagement with misinformation on social media is

whether the introduction of the Community Notes feature and its roll-out to
users in the U.S. and around the world have reduced engagement with

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models and Regression Discontinuity Design

introduced unprecedented challenges to public discourse, including
polarization, misinformation, and the emergence of echo chambers. While
existing research has extensively studied the behavior of active users within
echo chambers, little attention has been given to the hidden audience, also

analyze a polarized political debate to understand the engagement patterns and
factors influencing the hidden audience's presence. Our findings reveal a
relevant fraction of users that consume content without active interaction,
which underscores the importance of considering their presence in online

"As malicious actors employ increasingly advanced and widespread bots to
disseminate misinformation and manipulate public opinion, the detection of
Twitter bots has become a crucial task. Though graph-based Twitter bot
detection methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, we find that their
inference depends on the neighbor users multi-hop away from the targets, and
fetching neighbors is time-consuming and may introduce bias. At the same time,
we find that after finetuning on Twitter bot detection, pretrained language
models achieve competitive performance and do not require a graph structure
during deployment. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel bot detection
framework LMBot that distills the knowledge of graph neural networks (GNNs)
into language models (LMs) for graph-less deployment in Twitter bot detection
to combat the challenge of data dependency. Moreover, LMBot is compatible with
graph-based and graph-less datasets. Specifically, we first represent each user
as a textual sequence and feed them into the LM for domain adaptation. For
graph-based datasets, the output of LMs provides input features for the GNN,
enabling it to optimize for bot detection and distill knowledge back to the LM
in an iterative, mutually enhancing process. Armed with the LM, we can perform
graph-less inference, which resolves the graph data dependency and sampling
bias issues. For datasets without graph structure, we simply replace the GNN
with an MLP, which has also shown strong performance. Our experiments
demonstrate that LMBot achieves state-of-the-art performance on four Twitter
bot detection benchmarks. Extensive studies also show that LMBot is more

outcomes at a global scale. While many studies have focused on a qualitative
and quantitative understanding of misinformation, including sentiment analysis,
there is a gap in understanding the emotion-carriers of misinformation and
their differences across geographies. In this study, we characterized emotion
carriers and their impact on vaccination rates in India and the United States.
A manually labelled dataset was created from 2.3 million tweets and collated
with three publicly available datasets (CoAID, AntiVax, CMU) to train deep
learning models for misinformation classification. Misinformation labelled
tweets were further analyzed for behavioral aspects by leveraging Plutchik
Transformers to determine the emotion for each tweet. Time series analysis was
conducted to study the impact of misinformation on spatial and temporal
characteristics. Further, categorical classification was performed using
transformer models to assign categories for the misinformation tweets.
Word2Vec+BiLSTM was the best model for misinformation classification, with an
F1-score of 0.92. The US had the highest proportion of misinformation tweets
(58.02%), followed by the UK (10.38%) and India (7.33%). Disgust, anticipation,

tweets. Disgust was the predominant emotion associated with misinformation
tweets in the US, while anticipation was the predominant emotion in India. For
India, the misinformation rate exhibited a lead relationship with vaccination,
while in the US it lagged behind vaccination. Our study deciphered that

"Twitter bot detection has become an increasingly important and challenging
task to combat online misinformation, facilitate social content moderation, and
safeguard the integrity of social platforms. Though existing graph-based
Twitter bot detection methods achieved state-of-the-art performance, they are
all based on the homophily assumption, which assumes users with the same label
are more likely to be connected, making it easy for Twitter bots to disguise
themselves by following a large number of genuine users. To address this issue,
we proposed HOFA, a novel graph-based Twitter bot detection framework that
combats the heterophilous disguise challenge with a homophily-oriented graph
augmentation module (Homo-Aug) and a frequency adaptive attention module
(FaAt). Specifically, the Homo-Aug extracts user representations and computes a
k-NN graph using an MLP and improves Twitter's homophily by injecting the k-NN
graph. For the FaAt, we propose an attention mechanism that adaptively serves
as a low-pass filter along a homophilic edge and a high-pass filter along a
heterophilic edge, preventing user features from being over-smoothed by their
neighborhood. We also introduce a weight guidance loss to guide the frequency
adaptive attention module. Our experiments demonstrate that HOFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three widely-acknowledged Twitter bot detection

"The increasing proliferation of misinformation and its alarming impact have
motivated both industry and academia to develop approaches for fake news
detection. However, state-of-the-art approaches are usually trained on datasets
of smaller size or with a limited set of specific topics. As a consequence,
these models lack generalization capabilities and are not applicable to
real-world data. In this paper, we propose three models that adopt and
fine-tune state-of-the-art multimodal transformers for multimodal fake news
detection. We conduct an in-depth analysis by manipulating the input data aimed
to explore models performance in realistic use cases on social media. Our study
across multiple models demonstrates that these systems suffer significant
performance drops against manipulated data. To reduce the bias and improve
model generalization, we suggest training data augmentation to conduct more
meaningful experiments for fake news detection on social media. The proposed

"State-of-the-art language models (LMs) are notoriously susceptible to
generating hallucinated information. Such inaccurate outputs not only undermine
the reliability of these models but also limit their use and raise serious
concerns about misinformation and propaganda. In this work, we focus on
hallucinated book and article references and present them as the ""model
organism"" of language model hallucination research, due to their frequent and
easy-to-discern nature. We posit that if a language model cites a particular
reference in its output, then it should ideally possess sufficient information
about its authors and content, among other relevant details. Using this basic
insight, we illustrate that one can identify hallucinated references without
ever consulting any external resources, by asking a set of direct or indirect
queries to the language model about the references. These queries can be
considered as ""consistency checks."" Our findings highlight that while LMs,
including GPT-4, often produce inconsistent author lists for hallucinated
references, they also often accurately recall the authors of real references.
In this sense, the LM can be said to ""know"" when it is hallucinating
references. Furthermore, these findings show how hallucinated references can be
dissected to shed light on their nature. Replication code and results can be

"With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) and the huge amount

challenge for early-stage misinformation detection, where a good amount of data

"Deploying links to fact-checking websites (so-called ""snoping"") is a common
intervention that can be used by social media users to refute misleading

visibility and distrust towards professional fact-checkers. As a remedy,
Twitter launched its community-based fact-checking system Community Notes on
which fact-checks are carried out by actual Twitter users and directly shown on
the fact-checked tweets. Yet, an understanding of how fact-checking via
Community Notes differs from snoping is absent. In this study, we analyze
differences in how contributors to Community Notes and Snopers select their
targets when fact-checking social media posts. For this purpose, we analyze two
unique datasets from Twitter: (a) 25,912 community-created fact-checks from
Twitter's Community Notes platform; and (b) 52,505 ""snopes"" that debunk tweets

through the wisdom of crowds, summed reactions may help identifying relevant

To restore wisdom-of-crowds effects, it is therefore desirable to separate the
inauthentic agents from the wise crowd, and use only the latter as a voting

political bias, and verified status are also examined. This analysis provides
valuable observational evidence on whether the Twitter algorithm favours the
visibility of low-credibility content, with results indicating that tweets

intention (whether naive or malicious) behind sharing misinformation can only
be understood after observing their behavior after exposure to both the
misinformation and its refutation which the existing literature lacks to
consider. In this paper, we propose a labeling mechanism to label people as one
of the five defined categories based on the behavioral actions they exhibit
when exposed to misinformation and its refutation. However, everyone does not
show behavioral actions but is part of a network. Therefore, we use their
network features, extracted through deep learning-based graph embedding models,
to train a machine learning model for the prediction of the classes. We name
our approach behavioral forensics since it is an evidence-based investigation
of suspicious behavior which is spreading misinformation and disinformation in
our case. After evaluating our proposed model on a real-world Twitter dataset,
we achieved 77.45% precision and 75.80% recall in detecting the malicious
actors, who shared the misinformation even after receiving its refutation. Such
behavior shows intention, and hence these actors can rightfully be called
agents of disinformation spread.","['Euna Mehnaz Khan', 'Ayush Ram', 'Bhavtosh Rath', 'Emily Vraga', 'Jaideep Srivastava']",0,0.721171
"This paper examines how the European press dealt with the no-vax reactions

modeling, sentiment analysis, semantic relationship with word embeddings,
political analysis, named entity recognition, and semantic networks, to
understand the specific role of the European traditional press in the
disinformation ecosystem. The results of this multi-angle analysis demonstrate
that the European well-established press actively opposed a variety of hoaxes

"Class incremental learning approaches are useful as they help the model to
learn new information (classes) sequentially, while also retaining the
previously acquired information (classes). However, it has been shown that such
approaches are extremely vulnerable to the adversarial backdoor attacks, where
an intelligent adversary can introduce small amount of misinformation to the
model in the form of imperceptible backdoor pattern during training to cause
deliberate forgetting of a specific task or class at test time. In this work,
we propose a novel defensive framework to counter such an insidious attack
where, we use the attacker's primary strength-hiding the backdoor pattern by
making it imperceptible to humans-against it, and propose to learn a
perceptible (stronger) pattern (also during the training) that can overpower
the attacker's imperceptible (weaker) pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed defensive mechanism through various commonly used Replay-based
(both generative and exact replay-based) class incremental learning algorithms
using continual learning benchmark variants of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST
datasets. Most noteworthy, our proposed defensive framework does not assume
that the attacker's target task and target class is known to the defender. The
defender is also unaware of the shape, size, and location of the attacker's
pattern. We show that our proposed defensive framework considerably improves
the performance of class incremental learning algorithms with no knowledge of
the attacker's target task, attacker's target class, and attacker's
imperceptible pattern. We term our defensive framework as Adversary Aware
Continual Learning (AACL).","['Muhammad Umer', 'Robi Polikar']",7,0.5711394

misinformation. Nevertheless, few papers thoroughly discuss how. We document
this by analysing 100 highly-cited papers, and annotating epistemic elements
related to intended use, i.e., means, ends, and stakeholders. We find that
narratives leaving out some of these aspects are common, that many papers
propose inconsistent means and ends, and that the feasibility of suggested
strategies rarely has empirical backing. We argue that this vagueness actively
hinders the technology from reaching its goals, as it encourages overclaiming,
limits criticism, and prevents stakeholder feedback. Accordingly, we provide

"Multimedia content has become ubiquitous on social media platforms, leading
to the rise of multimodal misinformation (MM) and the urgent need for effective
strategies to detect and prevent its spread. In recent years, the challenge of
multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) has garnered significant attention by
researchers and has mainly involved the creation of annotated, weakly
annotated, or synthetically generated training datasets, along with the
development of various deep learning MMD models. However, the problem of
unimodal bias has been overlooked, where specific patterns and biases in MMD
benchmarks can result in biased or unimodal models outperforming their
multimodal counterparts on an inherently multimodal task; making it difficult
to assess progress. In this study, we systematically investigate and identify
the presence of unimodal bias in widely-used MMD benchmarks, namely VMU-Twitter
and COSMOS. To address this issue, we introduce the ""VERification of Image-TExt
pairs"" (VERITE) benchmark for MMD which incorporates real-world data, excludes
""asymmetric multimodal misinformation"" and utilizes ""modality balancing"". We
conduct an extensive comparative study with a Transformer-based architecture
that shows the ability of VERITE to effectively address unimodal bias,
rendering it a robust evaluation framework for MMD. Furthermore, we introduce a
new method -- termed Crossmodal HArd Synthetic MisAlignment (CHASMA) -- for
generating realistic synthetic training data that preserve crossmodal relations

"The emerging social network platforms enable users to share their own
opinions, as well as to exchange opinions with others. However, adversarial
network perturbation, where malicious users intentionally spread their extreme
opinions, rumors, and misinformation to others, is ubiquitous in social
networks. Such adversarial network perturbation greatly influences the opinion
formation of the public and threatens our societies. Thus, it is critical to
study and control the influence of adversarial network perturbation. Although
tremendous efforts have been made in both academia and industry to guide and
control the public opinion dynamics, most of these works assume that the
network is static, and ignore such adversarial network perturbation. In this
work, based on the well-accepted Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model, we
model the adversarial network perturbation and analyze its impact on the
networks' opinion. Then, from the adversary's perspective, we analyze its
optimal network perturbation, which maximally changes the network's opinion.
Next, from the network defender's perspective, we formulate a Stackelberg game
and aim to control the network's opinion even under such adversarial network
perturbation. We devise a projected subgradient algorithm to solve the
formulated Stackelberg game. Extensive simulations on real social networks

"Human societies are organized and developed through collective cooperative
behaviors, in which interactions between individuals are governed by the
underlying social connections. It is well known that, based on the information
in their environment, individuals can form collective cooperation by
strategically imitating superior behaviors and changing unfavorable
surroundings in self-organizing ways. However, facing the tough situation that
some humans and social bots keep spreading misinformation, we still lack the
systematic investigation on the impact of such proliferation of misinformation
on the evolution of social cooperation. Here we study this problem by virtue of
classical evolutionary game theory. We find that misinformation generally
impedes the emergence of collective cooperation compared to scenarios with
completely true information, although the level of cooperation is slightly
higher when the benefits provided by cooperators are reduced below a proven
threshold. We further show that this possible advantage shrinks as social
connections become denser, suggesting that misinformation is more detrimental
to the formation of collective cooperation when 'social viscosity' is low. Our
results uncover the quantitative effect of misinformation on the social
cooperative behavior in the complex networked society, and pave the way for
designing possible interventions to improve collective cooperation.","['Yao Meng', 'Mark Broom', 'Aming Li']",0,0.5446259
"The spread of misinformation in social media outlets has become a prevalent
societal problem and is the cause of many kinds of social unrest. Curtailing

machine learning to this problem. First, while much too prevalent in one
respect, misinformation, actually, represents only a minor proportion of all
the postings seen on social media. Second, labeling the massive amount of data
necessary to train a useful classifier becomes impractical. Considering these
challenges, we propose a simple semi-supervised learning framework in order to

"The growing reliance of society on social media for authentic information has

"In the era of social media, people frequently share their own opinions online
on various issues and also in the way, get exposed to others' opinions. Be it
for selective exposure of news feed recommendation algorithms or our own
inclination to listen to opinions that support ours, the result is that we get
more and more exposed to opinions closer to ours. Further, any population is
inherently heterogeneous i.e. people will hold a varied range of opinions
regarding a topic and showcase a varied range of openness to get influenced by
others. In this paper, we demonstrate the different behavior put forward by
open- and close-minded agents towards an issue, when allowed to freely intermix
and communicate.
  We have shown that the intermixing among people leads to formation of opinion
echo chambers i.e. a small closed network of people who hold similar opinions
and are not affected by opinions of people outside the network. Echo chambers
are evidently harmful for a society because it inhibits free healthy
communication among all and thus, prevents exchange of opinions, spreads
misinformation and increases extremist beliefs. This calls for reduction in
echo chambers, because a total consensus of opinion is neither possible nor is
welcome. We show that the number of echo chambers depends on the number of
close-minded agents and cannot be lessened by increasing the number of
open-minded agents. We identify certain 'moderate'-minded agents, who possess
the capability of manipulating and reducing the number of echo chambers. The
paper proposes an algorithm for intelligent placement of moderate-minded agents
in the opinion-time spectrum by which the opinion echo chambers can be
maximally reduced. With various experimental setups, we demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm fares well when compared to placement of other agents (open-

"Misinformation has become a growing issue on online social platforms (OSPs),
especially during elections or pandemics. To combat this, OSPs have implemented
various policies, such as tagging, to notify users about potentially misleading
information. However, these policies are often transparent and therefore
susceptible to being exploited by content creators, who may not be willing to
invest effort into producing authentic content, causing the viral spread of
misinformation. Instead of mitigating the reach of existing misinformation,
this work focuses on a solution of prevention, aiming to stop the spread of
misinformation before it has a chance to gain momentum. We propose a Bayesian
persuaded branching process ($\operatorname{BP}^2$) to model the strategic
interactions among the OSP, the content creator, and the user. The
misinformation spread on OSP is modeled by a multi-type branching process,
where users' positive and negative comments influence the misinformation
spreading. Using a Lagrangian induced by Bayesian plausibility, we characterize
the OSP's optimal policy under the perfect Bayesian equilibrium. The convexity
of the Lagrangian implies that the OSP's optimal policy is simply the fully
informative tagging policy: revealing the content's accuracy to the user. Such
a tagging policy solicits the best effort from the content creator in reducing
misinformation, even though the OSP exerts no direct control over the content
creator. We corroborate our findings using numerical simulations.","['Ya-Ting Yang', 'Tao Li', 'Quanyan Zhu']",2,0.59832895

evaluation of the information source. The models identifying unreliable threads
usually rely on textual features. But reliability is not just what is said, but
by whom and to whom. We additionally leverage on network information. Following
the homophily principle, we hypothesize that users who interact are generally
interested in similar topics and spreading similar kind of news, which in turn
is generally reliable or not. We test several methods to learn representations
of the social interactions within the cascades, combining them with deep neural
language models in a Multi-Input (MI) framework. Keeping track of the sequence
of the interactions during the time, we improve over previous state-of-the-art
models.","['Tommaso Fornaciari', 'Luca Luceri', 'Emilio Ferrara', 'Dirk Hovy']",4,0.6966403
"One of the new developments in chit-chat bots is a long-term memory mechanism
that remembers information from past conversations for increasing engagement
and consistency of responses. The bot is designed to extract knowledge of
personal nature from their conversation partner, e.g., stating preference for a
particular color. In this paper, we show that this memory mechanism can result
in unintended behavior. In particular, we found that one can combine a personal
statement with an informative statement that would lead the bot to remember the
informative statement alongside personal knowledge in its long term memory.
This means that the bot can be tricked into remembering misinformation which it
would regurgitate as statements of fact when recalling information relevant to
the topic of conversation. We demonstrate this vulnerability on the BlenderBot
2 framework implemented on the ParlAI platform and provide examples on the more
recent and significantly larger BlenderBot 3 model. We generate 150 examples of
misinformation, of which 114 (76%) were remembered by BlenderBot 2 when
combined with a personal statement. We further assessed the risk of this
misinformation being recalled after intervening innocuous conversation and in
response to multiple questions relevant to the injected memory. Our evaluation
was performed on both the memory-only and the combination of memory and
internet search modes of BlenderBot 2. From the combinations of these
variables, we generated 12,890 conversations and analyzed recalled
misinformation in the responses. We found that when the chat bot is questioned
on the misinformation topic, it was 328% more likely to respond with the
misinformation as fact when the misinformation was in the long-term memory.","['Conor Atkins', 'Benjamin Zi Hao Zhao', 'Hassan Jameel Asghar', 'Ian Wood', 'Mohamed Ali Kaafar']",13,0.6713575
"Misinformation has become a pressing issue. Fake media, in both visual and
textual forms, is widespread on the web. While various deepfake detection and
text fake news detection methods have been proposed, they are only designed for
single-modality forgery based on binary classification, let alone analyzing and
reasoning subtle forgery traces across different modalities. In this paper, we
highlight a new research problem for multi-modal fake media, namely Detecting
and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM^4). DGM^4 aims to not only
detect the authenticity of multi-modal media, but also ground the manipulated
content (i.e., image bounding boxes and text tokens), which requires deeper
reasoning of multi-modal media manipulation. To support a large-scale
investigation, we construct the first DGM^4 dataset, where image-text pairs are
manipulated by various approaches, with rich annotation of diverse
manipulations. Moreover, we propose a novel HierArchical Multi-modal
Manipulation rEasoning tRansformer (HAMMER) to fully capture the fine-grained
interaction between different modalities. HAMMER performs 1) manipulation-aware
contrastive learning between two uni-modal encoders as shallow manipulation
reasoning, and 2) modality-aware cross-attention by multi-modal aggregator as
deep manipulation reasoning. Dedicated manipulation detection and grounding
heads are integrated from shallow to deep levels based on the interacted
multi-modal information. Finally, we build an extensive benchmark and set up
rigorous evaluation metrics for this new research problem. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model; several valuable
observations are also revealed to facilitate future research in multi-modal

"Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in cyber crimes and system
failures caused by misinformation. Many of these instances can be classified as
gaslighting, which involves manipulating the perceptions of others through the
use of information. In this paper, we propose a dynamic game-theoretic
framework built on a partially observed stochastic control system to study
gaslighting. The decision-maker (DM) in the game only accesses partial
observations, and she determines the controls by constructing information
states that capture her perceptions of the system. The gaslighter in the game
influences the system indirectly by designing the observations to manipulate
the DM's perceptions and decisions. We analyze the impact of the gaslighter's
efforts using robustness analysis of the information states and optimal value
to deviations in the observations. A stealthiness constraint is introduced to
restrict the power of the gaslighter and to help him stay undetected. We
consider approximate feedback Stackelberg equilibrium as the solution concept
and estimate the cost of gaslighting.","['Shutian Liu', 'Quanyan Zhu']",0,0.592673
"The explosive growth of online misinformation, such as false claims, has
affected the social behavior of online users. In order to be persuasive and
mislead the audience, false claims are made to trigger emotions in their
audience. This paper contributes to understanding how misinformation in social
media is shaped by investigating the emotional framing that authors of the
claims try to create for their audience. We investigate how, firstly, the
existence of emotional framing in the claims depends on the topic and
credibility of the claims. Secondly, we explore how emotionally framed content
triggers emotional response posts by social media users, and how emotions
expressed in claims and corresponding users' response posts affect their
sharing behavior on social media. Analysis of four data sets covering different
topics (politics, health, Syrian war, and COVID-19) reveals that authors shape
their claims depending on the topic area to pass targeted emotions to their
audience. By analysing responses to claims, we show that the credibility of the
claim influences the distribution of emotions that the claim incites in its
audience. Moreover, our analysis shows that emotions expressed in the claims
are repeated in the users' responses. Finally, the analysis of users' sharing
behavior shows that negative emotional framing such as anger, fear, and sadness
of false claims leads to more interaction among users than positive emotions.
This analysis also reveals that in the claims that trigger happy responses,
true claims result in more sharing compared to false claims.","['Akram Sadat Hosseini', 'Steffen Staab']",3,0.69618

"Adaptive design optimization (ADO) is a state-of-the-art technique for
experimental design (Cavagnaro, Myung, Pitt, & Kujala, 2010). ADO dynamically
identifies stimuli that, in expectation, yield the most information about a
hypothetical construct of interest (e.g., parameters of a cognitive model). To
calculate this expectation, ADO leverages the modeler's existing knowledge,
specified in the form of a prior distribution. Informative priors align with
the distribution of the focal construct in the participant population. This
alignment is assumed by ADO's internal assessment of expected information gain.
If the prior is instead misinformative, i.e., does not align with the
participant population, ADO's estimates of expected information gain could be
inaccurate. In many cases, the true distribution that characterizes the
participant population is unknown, and experimenters rely on heuristics in
their choice of prior and without an understanding of how this choice affects
ADO's behavior.
  Our work introduces a mathematical framework that facilitates investigation
of the consequences of the choice of prior distribution on the efficiency of
experiments designed using ADO. Through theoretical and empirical results, we
show that, in the context of prior misinformation, measures of expected
information gain are distinct from the correctness of the corresponding
inference. Through a series of simulation experiments, we show that, in the
case of parameter estimation, ADO nevertheless outperforms other design
methods. Conversely, in the case of model selection, misinformative priors can
lead inference to favor the wrong model, and rather than mitigating this
pitfall, ADO exacerbates it.","['Sabina J. Sloman', 'Daniel Cavagnaro', 'Stephen B. Broomell']",2,0.60251844
"For more than a decade scholars have been investigating the disinformation
flow on social media contextually to societal events, like, e.g., elections. In
this paper, we analyze the Twitter traffic related to the US 2020 pre-election
debate and ask whether it mirrors the electoral system. The U.S. electoral
system provides that, regardless of the actual vote gap, the premier candidate
who received more votes in one state `takes' that state. Criticisms of this
system have pointed out that election campaigns can be more intense in
particular key states to achieve victory, so-called {\it swing states}. Our
intuition is that election debate may cause more traffic on Twitter-and
probably be more plagued by misinformation-when associated with swing states.
The results mostly confirm the intuition. About 88\% of the entire traffic can
be associated with swing states, and links to non-trustworthy news are shared
far more in swing-related traffic than the same type of news in safe-related
traffic. Considering traffic origin instead, non-trustworthy tweets generated
by automated accounts, so-called social bots, are mostly associated with swing
states. Our work sheds light on the role an electoral system plays in the

"In recent years, industry leaders and researchers have proposed to use
technical provenance standards to address visual misinformation spread through
digitally altered media. By adding immutable and secure provenance information
such as authorship and edit date to media metadata, social media users could
potentially better assess the validity of the media they encounter. However, it
is unclear how end users would respond to provenance information, or how to
best design provenance indicators to be understandable to laypeople. We
conducted an online experiment with 595 participants from the US and UK to
investigate how provenance information altered users' accuracy perceptions and
trust in visual content shared on social media. We found that provenance
information often lowered trust and caused users to doubt deceptive media,
particularly when it revealed that the media was composited. We additionally
tested conditions where the provenance information itself was shown to be
incomplete or invalid, and found that these states have a significant impact on
participants' accuracy perceptions and trust in media, leading them, in some
cases, to disbelieve honest media. Our findings show that provenance, although
enlightening, is still not a concept well-understood by users, who confuse
media credibility with the orthogonal (albeit related) concept of provenance
credibility. We discuss how design choices may contribute to provenance

negatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide
a systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and
ethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders.
Although text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is
crucial to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range
of areas to which it may be deployed. We describe seven primary ways in which
RLHF-based technologies will affect society by positively transforming human
experiences with AI. This paper ultimately proposes that RLHF has potential to
net positively impact areas of misinformation, AI value-alignment, bias, AI
access, cross-cultural dialogue, industry, and workforce. As RLHF raises
concerns that echo those of existing AI technologies, it will be important for
all to be aware and intentional in the adoption of RLHF.",['Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu'],9,0.6848097
"AI Generated Content (AIGC) has received tremendous attention within the past
few years, with content generated in the format of image, text, audio, video,

criticism regarding its responsible usage. In this article, we focus on 8 main
concerns that may hinder the healthy development and deployment of AIGC in
practice, including risks from (1) privacy; (2) bias, toxicity, misinformation;
(3) intellectual property (IP); (4) robustness; (5) open source and

"With the expansion of social media and the increasing dissemination of
multimedia content, the spread of misinformation has become a major concern.
This necessitates effective strategies for multimodal misinformation detection
(MMD) that detect whether the combination of an image and its accompanying text
could mislead or misinform. Due to the data-intensive nature of deep neural
networks and the labor-intensive process of manual annotation, researchers have
been exploring various methods for automatically generating synthetic
multimodal misinformation - which we refer to as Synthetic Misinformers - in
order to train MMD models. However, limited evaluation on real-world
misinformation and a lack of comparisons with other Synthetic Misinformers
makes difficult to assess progress in the field. To address this, we perform a
comparative study on existing and new Synthetic Misinformers that involves (1)
out-of-context (OOC) image-caption pairs, (2) cross-modal named entity
inconsistency (NEI) as well as (3) hybrid approaches and we evaluate them
against real-world misinformation; using the COSMOS benchmark. The comparative
study showed that our proposed CLIP-based Named Entity Swapping can lead to MMD
models that surpass other OOC and NEI Misinformers in terms of multimodal
accuracy and that hybrid approaches can lead to even higher detection accuracy.
Nevertheless, after alleviating information leakage from the COSMOS evaluation
protocol, low Sensitivity scores indicate that the task is significantly more
challenging than previous studies suggested. Finally, our findings showed that
NEI-based Synthetic Misinformers tend to suffer from a unimodal bias, where
text-only MMDs can outperform multimodal ones.","['Stefanos-Iordanis Papadopoulos', 'Christos Koutlis', 'Symeon Papadopoulos', 'Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis']",2,0.7033639

across the three platforms. The results indicate that Parler had lower toxicity
levels than both Twitter and Reddit in discussions related to COVID-19. In
contrast, Reddit showed the highest levels of toxicity, largely due to various
anti-vaccine forums that spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.
Notably, our analysis of COVID-19 vaccination conversations on Twitter also
revealed a significant presence of conspiracy theories among individuals with
highly toxic attitudes. Our computational approach provides decision-makers

"Information cascade in online social networks can be rather negative, e.g.,
the spread of rumors may trigger panic. To limit the influence of
misinformation in an effective and efficient manner, the influence minimization
(IMIN) problem is studied in the literature: given a graph G and a seed set S,
blocking at most b vertices such that the influence spread of the seed set is
minimized. In this paper, we are the first to prove the IMIN problem is NP-hard
and hard to approximate. Due to the hardness of the problem, existing works
resort to greedy solutions and use Monte-Carlo Simulations to solve the
problem. However, they are cost-prohibitive on large graphs since they have to
enumerate all the candidate blockers and compute the decrease of expected
spread when blocking each of them. To improve the efficiency, we propose the
AdvancedGreedy algorithm (AG) based on a new graph sampling technique that
applies the dominator tree structure, which can compute the decrease of the
expected spread of all candidate blockers at once. Besides, we further propose
the GreedyReplace algorithm (GR) by considering the relationships among
candidate blockers. Extensive experiments on 8 real-life graphs demonstrate
that our AG and GR algorithms are significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art by up to 6 orders of magnitude, and GR can achieve better

"Deep learning constitutes a pivotal component within the realm of machine
learning, offering remarkable capabilities in tasks ranging from image
recognition to natural language processing. However, this very strength also
renders deep learning models susceptible to adversarial examples, a phenomenon
pervasive across a diverse array of applications. These adversarial examples
are characterized by subtle perturbations artfully injected into clean images
or videos, thereby causing deep learning algorithms to misclassify or produce
erroneous outputs. This susceptibility extends beyond the confines of digital
domains, as adversarial examples can also be strategically designed to target
human cognition, leading to the creation of deceptive media, such as deepfakes.
Deepfakes, in particular, have emerged as a potent tool to manipulate public
opinion and tarnish the reputations of public figures, underscoring the urgent
need to address the security and ethical implications associated with
adversarial examples. This article delves into the multifaceted world of
adversarial examples, elucidating the underlying principles behind their
capacity to deceive deep learning algorithms. We explore the various
manifestations of this phenomenon, from their insidious role in compromising
model reliability to their impact in shaping the contemporary landscape of
disinformation and misinformation. To illustrate progress in combating
adversarial examples, we showcase the development of a tailored Convolutional

"Misinformation is an important topic in the Information Retrieval (IR)
context and has implications for both system-centered and user-centered IR.
While it has been established that the performance in discerning misinformation
is affected by a person's cognitive load, the variation in cognitive load in
judging the veracity of news is less understood. To understand the variation in
cognitive load imposed by reading news headlines related to COVID-19 claims,
within the context of a fact-checking system, we conducted a within-subject,
lab-based, quasi-experiment (N=40) with eye-tracking. Our results suggest that
examining true claims imposed a higher cognitive load on participants when news
headlines provided incorrect evidence for a claim and were inconsistent with
the person's prior beliefs. In contrast, checking false claims imposed a higher
cognitive load when the news headlines provided correct evidence for a claim
and were consistent with the participants' prior beliefs. However, changing
beliefs after examining a claim did not have a significant relationship with
cognitive load while reading the news headlines. The results illustrate that
reading news headlines related to true and false claims in the fact-checking
context impose different levels of cognitive load. Our findings suggest that
user engagement with tools for discerning misinformation needs to account for

among the younger generation. With the increasing popularity of news
consumption on various social media platforms, there has been a surge of
misinformation which includes false information or unfounded claims. As various

reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to simulate the adversarial behavior of
fraudsters on social media. Research has shown that in real-world settings,
fraudsters coordinate with each other to share different news in order to evade
the detection of fake news detectors. Therefore, we modeled our MARL framework
as a Markov Game with bot, cyborg, and crowd worker agents, which have their
own distinctive cost, budget, and influence. We then use deep Q-learning to
search for the optimal policy that maximizes the rewards. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world fake news propagation datasets
demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively sabotage the GNN-based
fake news detector performance. We hope this paper can provide insights for

"Misinformation on social media presents a major threat to modern societies.
While previous research has analyzed the virality across true and false social
media posts, not every misleading post is necessarily equally viral. Rather,
misinformation has different characteristics and varies in terms of its
believability and harmfulness - which might influence its spread. In this work,
we study how the perceived believability and harmfulness of misleading posts
are associated with their virality on social media. Specifically, we analyze
(and validate) a large sample of crowd-annotated social media posts from
Twitter's Birdwatch platform, on which users can rate the believability and
harmfulness of misleading tweets. To address our research questions, we
implement an explanatory regression model and link the crowd ratings for
believability and harmfulness to the virality of misleading posts on Twitter.
Our findings imply that misinformation that is (i) easily believable and (ii)
not particularly harmful is associated with more viral resharing cascades.
These results offer insights into how different kinds of crowd fact-checked
misinformation spreads and suggest that the most viral misleading posts are
often not the ones that are particularly concerning from the perspective of

investigated how the benefits from these algorithms (via reduction in exposure
to misinformation) are distributed amongst various online communities. In this

propagation through the network using our novel Topic-Aware, Community-Impacted

diversity into how fact-checkers use algorithmic recommendations can actively
reduce inequalities in benefits between majority and minority communities.

"During a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, a credible and
easy-to-access information portal is highly desirable. It helps with disease
prevention, public health planning, and misinformation mitigation. However,
creating such an information portal is challenging because 1) domain expertise
is required to identify and curate credible and intelligible content, 2) the
information needs to be updated promptly in response to the fast-changing
environment, and 3) the information should be easily accessible by the general
public; which is particularly difficult when most people do not have the domain
expertise about the crisis. In this paper, we presented an expert-sourcing
framework and created Jennifer, an AI chatbot, which serves as a credible and
easy-to-access information portal for individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Jennifer was created by a team of over 150 scientists and health professionals
around the world, deployed in the real world and answered thousands of user
questions about COVID-19. We evaluated Jennifer from two key stakeholders'
perspectives, expert volunteers and information seekers. We first interviewed
experts who contributed to the collaborative creation of Jennifer to learn
about the challenges in the process and opportunities for future improvement.
We then conducted an online experiment that examined Jennifer's effectiveness
in supporting information seekers in locating COVID-19 information and gaining
their trust. We share the key lessons learned and discuss design implications
for building expert-sourced and AI-powered information portals, along with the
risks and opportunities of misinformation mitigation and beyond.","['Ziang Xiao', 'Q. Vera Liao', 'Michelle X. Zhou', 'Tyrone Grandison', 'Yunyao Li']",5,0.62209606

"With the advent of deep learning, text generation language models have
improved dramatically, with text at a similar level as human-written text. This
can lead to rampant misinformation because content can now be created cheaply
and distributed quickly. Automated claim verification methods exist to validate
claims, but they lack foundational data and often use mainstream news as
evidence sources that are strongly biased towards a specific agenda. Current
claim verification methods use deep neural network models and complex
algorithms for a high classification accuracy but it is at the expense of model
explainability. The models are black-boxes and their decision-making process
and the steps it took to arrive at a final prediction are obfuscated from the
user. We introduce a novel claim verification approach, namely: ExClaim, that
attempts to provide an explainable claim verification system with foundational
evidence. Inspired by the legal system, ExClaim leverages rationalization to
provide a verdict for the claim and justifies the verdict through a natural
language explanation (rationale) to describe the model's decision-making
process. ExClaim treats the verdict classification task as a question-answer
problem and achieves a performance of 0.93 F1 score. It provides subtasks
explanations to also justify the intermediate outcomes. Statistical and
Explainable AI (XAI) evaluations are conducted to ensure valid and trustworthy
outcomes. Ensuring claim verification systems are assured, rational, and
explainable is an essential step toward improving Human-AI trust and the
accessibility of black-box systems.","['Sai Gurrapu', 'Lifu Huang', 'Feras A. Batarseh']",1,0.8321103
"Toxic misinformation campaigns have caused significant societal harm, e.g.,
affecting elections and COVID-19 information awareness. Unfortunately, despite
successes of (gold standard) retrospective studies of misinformation that
confirmed their harmful effects after the fact, they arrive too late for timely
intervention and reduction of such harm. By design, misinformation evades
retrospective classifiers by exploiting two properties we call new-normal: (1)
never-seen-before novelty that cause inescapable generalization challenges for
previous classifiers, and (2) massive but short campaigns that end before they
can be manually annotated for new classifier training. To tackle these
challenges, we propose UFIT, which combines two techniques: semantic masking of
strong signal keywords to reduce overfitting, and intra-proxy smoothness
regularization of high-density regions in the latent space to improve
reliability and maintain accuracy. Evaluation of UFIT on public new-normal
misinformation data shows over 30% improvement over existing approaches on
future (and unseen) campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, UFIT is the first
successful effort to achieve such high level of generalization on new-normal

third-party bot detection. These tools employ machine learning and often
achieve near perfect performance for classification on existing datasets,
suggesting bot detection is accurate, reliable and fit for use in downstream

decision rules -- shallow decision trees trained on a small number of features
-- achieve near-state-of-the-art performance on most available datasets and
that bot detection datasets, even when combined together, do not generalize
well to out-of-sample datasets. Our findings reveal that predictions are highly

"Misinformation threatens modern society by promoting distrust in science,
changing narratives in public health, heightening social polarization, and
disrupting democratic elections and financial markets, among a myriad of other
societal harms. To address this, a growing cadre of professional fact-checkers

However, these largely manual efforts have struggled to match the enormous
scale of the problem. In response, a growing body of Natural Language

fact-checking. Despite tremendous growth in such research, however, practical
adoption of NLP technologies for fact-checking still remains in its infancy

"Networked discrete dynamical systems are often used to model the spread of
contagions and decision-making by agents in coordination games. Fixed points of
such dynamical systems represent configurations to which the system converges.
In the dissemination of undesirable contagions (such as rumors and

nodes is a desirable goal. Motivated by such considerations, we formulate a
novel optimization problem of finding a nontrivial fixed point of the system
with the minimum number of affected nodes. We establish that, unless P = NP,
there is no polynomial time algorithm for approximating a solution to this
problem to within the factor n^1-\epsilon for any constant epsilon > 0. To cope
with this computational intractability, we identify several special cases for
which the problem can be solved efficiently. Further, we introduce an integer

solving the problem on larger networks, we propose a general heuristic

"The increasing popularity of online social networks (OSNs) attracted growing
interest in modeling social interactions. On online social platforms, a few

We derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the temporal evolution of users' opinion
distribution and analytically characterize the stationary system behavior.
Analytical results, confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, show how strict forms
of content personalization tend to radicalize user opinion, leading to the
emergence of echo chambers, and favor structurally advantaged influencers. As

"Fake videos represent an important misinformation threat. While existing
forensic networks have demonstrated strong performance on image forgeries,
recent results reported on the Adobe VideoSham dataset show that these networks
fail to identify fake content in videos. In this paper, we show that this is
due to video coding, which introduces local variation into forensic traces. In
response, we propose VideoFACT - a new network that is able to detect and
localize a wide variety of video forgeries and manipulations. To overcome
challenges that existing networks face when analyzing videos, our network
utilizes both forensic embeddings to capture traces left by manipulation,
context embeddings to control for variation in forensic traces introduced by
video coding, and a deep self-attention mechanism to estimate the quality and
relative importance of local forensic embeddings. We create several new video
forgery datasets and use these, along with publicly available data, to
experimentally evaluate our network's performance. These results show that our
proposed network is able to identify a diverse set of video forgeries,
including those not encountered during training. Furthermore, we show that our
network can be fine-tuned to achieve even stronger performance on challenging
AI-based manipulations.","['Tai D. Nguyen', 'Shengbang Fang', 'Matthew C. Stamm']",11,0.6583233
"Approaches to disease control are influenced by and reflected in public
opinion, and the two are intrinsically entwined. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in
British cattle and badgers is one example where there is a high degree of
polarisation in opinion. Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), on the other hand, does
not have the same controversy.
  In this paper we examine how language subjectivity on Twitter differs when
comparing the discourses surrounding bTB and BVD, using a combination of
network analysis and language and sentiment analysis. That data used for this
study was collected from the Twitter public API over a two-year period. We
investigated the network structure, language content, and user profiles of
tweets featuring both diseases.
  While analysing network structure showed little difference between the two
disease topics, elements of the structure allowed us to better investigate the
language structure and profile of users. We found distinct differences between
the language and sentiment used in tweets about each disease, and in the
profile of the users who were doing the tweeting. We hope that this will guide
further investigation and potential avenues for surveillance or the control of
misinformation.","['Christopher J. Banks', 'Jessica Enright', 'Sibylle Mohr', 'Rowland R. Kao']",5,0.6501105
"Systems for large scale deliberation have resolved polarized issues and
shifted agenda setting into the public's hands. These systems integrate
bridging-based ranking algorithms - including group informed consensus
implemented in Polis and the continuous matrix factorization approach

resolution. I provide initial validation of the approach by comparing the
method's output to a set of hypotheses drawn from the literature and by
inspecting the ""belief landscape"" generated by the method. My analysis
indicates that the method is relatively robust to different parameter settings,
and results suggest that 1) there are many stable configurations of belief, or
attractors, on the polarizing issue of climate change and 2) that people move
in predictable ways around these attractors. The method paves the way for more

"Anti-vaccination views pervade online social media, fueling distrust in
scientific expertise and increasing vaccine-hesitant individuals. While
previous studies focused on specific countries, the COVID-19 pandemic brought
the vaccination discourse worldwide, underpinning the need to tackle
low-credible information flows on a global scale to design effective
countermeasures. Here, we leverage 316 million vaccine-related Twitter messages
in 18 languages, from October 2019 to March 2021, to quantify misinformation
flows between users exposed to anti-vaccination (no-vax) content. We find that,
during the pandemic, no-vax communities became more central in the
country-specific debates and their cross-border connections strengthened,
revealing a global Twitter anti-vaccination network. U.S. users are central in
this network, while Russian users also become net exporters of misinformation

"Online forums that allow for participatory engagement between users have been
transformative for the public discussion of many important issues. However,
such conversations can sometimes escalate into full-blown exchanges of hate and
misinformation. Existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP), such
as deep learning models for classification tasks, use as inputs only a single
comment or a pair of comments depending upon whether the task concerns the
inference of properties of the individual comments or the replies between pairs
of comments, respectively. But in online conversations, comments and replies
may be based on external context beyond the immediately relevant information
that is input to the model. Therefore, being aware of the conversations'
surrounding contexts should improve the model's performance for the inference
task at hand.
  We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses
graph walks to incorporate the wider context of a conversation in a principled
manner. Specifically, a graph walk starts from a given comment and samples
""nearby"" comments in the same or parallel conversation threads, which results
in additional embeddings that are aggregated together with the initial
comment's embedding. We then use these enriched embeddings for downstream NLP
prediction tasks that are important for online conversations. We evaluate
GraphNLI on two such tasks - polarity prediction and misogynistic hate speech
detection - and found that our model consistently outperforms all relevant

"It's been controversial whether re-opening school will facilitate viral
spread among household communities with mitigation strategies such as
mask-wearing in place. In this work, we propose an epidemiological model that
explores the viral transmission over the multi-layer contact network composed
of the school layer and community layer with population heterogeneity on
mask-wearing behavior. We derive analytical expressions for three key
epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic
threshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the
aforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the multi-layer contact
network, viral transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different
types of masks within the population. Through extensive simulations, our
analytical results show near-perfect agreement with the simulation results with
a limited number of nodes. Utilizing the model, we study the impact of the
opening/closure of the school layer on the viral transmission dynamics with
various mask-wearing scenarios. Interestingly, we found that it's safe to open
the school layer with the proper proportion of good-quality masks in the
population. Moreover, we validate the theory of the trade-off between
source-control and self-protection over a single layer by Tian et al on our
multi-layer setting. We conclude that even on a multi-layer network, it's of
great significance to treat the spreading process as two distinct phases in
mind when considering mitigation strategies. Besides, we would like to remark
that our model of spreading process over multi-layer networks with population
heterogeneity can also be applied to various other domains, such as

user polarization and reflexivity. We show that this difference can be used to
alter network dynamics in a way that selectively hinders the spread of

fact-checking is a hard task in general, in many cases, false statements can be
easily debunked based on analytics over tables with reliable information.
Hence, table-based fact verification has recently emerged as an important and

common table operations, such as aggregating a column or comparing tuples. To

"The increasing reliance on online communities for healthcare information by

"In this paper, we present results of an auditing study performed over YouTube
aimed at investigating how fast a user can get into a misinformation filter
bubble, but also what it takes to ""burst the bubble"", i.e., revert the bubble
enclosure. We employ a sock puppet audit methodology, in which pre-programmed
agents (acting as YouTube users) delve into misinformation filter bubbles by
watching misinformation promoting content. Then they try to burst the bubbles
and reach more balanced recommendations by watching misinformation debunking
content. We record search results, home page results, and recommendations for
the watched videos. Overall, we recorded 17,405 unique videos, out of which we
manually annotated 2,914 for the presence of misinformation. The labeled data
was used to train a machine learning model classifying videos into three
classes (promoting, debunking, neutral) with the accuracy of 0.82. We use the
trained model to classify the remaining videos that would not be feasible to
annotate manually.
  Using both the manually and automatically annotated data, we observe the
misinformation bubble dynamics for a range of audited topics. Our key finding
is that even though filter bubbles do not appear in some situations, when they
do, it is possible to burst them by watching misinformation debunking content
(albeit it manifests differently from topic to topic). We also observe a sudden
decrease of misinformation filter bubble effect when misinformation debunking
videos are watched after misinformation promoting videos, suggesting a strong
contextuality of recommendations. Finally, when comparing our results with a
previous similar study, we do not observe significant improvements in the
overall quantity of recommended misinformation content.","['Ivan Srba', 'Robert Moro', 'Matus Tomlein', 'Branislav Pecher', 'Jakub Simko', 'Elena Stefancova', 'Michal Kompan', 'Andrea Hrckova', 'Juraj Podrouzek', 'Adrian Gavornik', 'Maria Bielikova']",3,0.58172995
"Social media platforms often assume that users can self-correct against
misinformation. However, social media users are not equally susceptible to all
misinformation as their biases influence what types of misinformation might
thrive and who might be at risk. We call ""diverse misinformation"" the complex
relationships between human biases and demographics represented in
misinformation. To investigate how users' biases impact their susceptibility
and their ability to correct each other, we analyze classification of deepfakes
as a type of diverse misinformation. We chose deepfakes as a case study for
three reasons: 1) their classification as misinformation is more objective; 2)
we can control the demographics of the personas presented; 3) deepfakes are a
real-world concern with associated harms that must be better understood. Our
paper presents an observational survey (N=2,016) where participants are exposed
to videos and asked questions about their attributes, not knowing some might be
deepfakes. Our analysis investigates the extent to which different users are
duped and which perceived demographics of deepfake personas tend to mislead. We
find that accuracy varies by demographics, and participants are generally
better at classifying videos that match them. We extrapolate from these results
to understand the potential population-level impacts of these biases using a
mathematical model of the interplay between diverse misinformation and crowd
correction. Our model suggests that diverse contacts might provide ""herd
correction"" where friends can protect each other. Altogether, human biases and
the attributes of misinformation matter greatly, but having a diverse social
group may help reduce susceptibility to misinformation.","['Juniper Lovato', 'Laurent Hébert-Dufresne', 'Jonathan St-Onge', 'Randall Harp', 'Gabriela Salazar Lopez', 'Sean P. Rogers', 'Ijaz Ul Haq', 'Jeremiah Onaolapo']",3,0.75454015
"Question generation has recently gained a lot of research interest,
especially with the advent of large language models. In and of itself, question
generation can be considered 'AI-hard', as there is a lack of unanimously
agreed sense of what makes a question 'good' or 'bad'. In this paper, we tackle
two fundamental problems in parallel: on one hand, we try to solve the scaling
problem, where question-generation and answering applications have to be
applied to a massive amount of text without ground truth labeling. The usual
approach to solve this problem is to either downsample or summarize. However,
there are critical risks of misinformation with these approaches. On the other
hand, and related to the misinformation problem, we try to solve the 'safety'
problem, as many public institutions rely on a much higher level of accuracy
for the content they provide. We introduce an adversarial approach to tackle
the question generation safety problem with scale. Specifically, we designed a
question-answering system that specifically prunes out unanswerable questions
that may be generated, and further increases the quality of the answers that
are generated. We build a production-ready, easily-plugged pipeline that can be
used on any given body of text, that is scalable and immune from generating any
hate speech, profanity, or misinformation. Based on the results, we are able to
generate more than six times the number of quality questions generated by the
abstractive approach, with a perceived quality being 44% higher, according to a
survey of 168 participants.","['Sreehari Sankar', 'Zhihang Dong']",9,0.61653745
"This study investigated and compared public sentiment related to COVID-19
vaccines expressed on two popular social media platforms, Reddit and Twitter,
harvested from January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2022. To accomplish this task, we
created a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to predict sentiments of approximately
9.5 million Tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments. To fine-tune our model, our
team manually labeled the sentiment of 3600 Tweets and then augmented our
dataset by the method of back-translation. Text sentiment for each social media
platform was then classified with our fine-tuned model using Python and the
Huggingface sentiment analysis pipeline. Our results determined that the
average sentiment expressed on Twitter was more negative (52% positive) than
positive and the sentiment expressed on Reddit was more positive than negative
(53% positive). Though average sentiment was found to vary between these social
media platforms, both displayed similar behavior related to sentiment shared at
key vaccine-related developments during the pandemic. Considering this similar
trend in shared sentiment demonstrated across social media platforms, Twitter
and Reddit continue to be valuable data sources that public health officials
can utilize to strengthen vaccine confidence and combat misinformation. As the
spread of misinformation poses a range of psychological and psychosocial risks
(anxiety, fear, etc.), there is an urgency in understanding the public
perspective and attitude toward shared falsities. Comprehensive educational
delivery systems tailored to the population's expressed sentiments that
facilitate digital literacy, health information-seeking behavior, and precision

"Speech synthesis methods can create realistic-sounding speech, which may be
used for fraud, spoofing, and misinformation campaigns. Forensic methods that
detect synthesized speech are important for protection against such attacks.
Forensic attribution methods provide even more information about the nature of
synthesized speech signals because they identify the specific speech synthesis
method (i.e., speech synthesizer) used to create a speech signal. Due to the
increasing number of realistic-sounding speech synthesizers, we propose a
speech attribution method that generalizes to new synthesizers not seen during
training. To do so, we investigate speech synthesizer attribution in both a
closed set scenario and an open set scenario. In other words, we consider some
speech synthesizers to be ""known"" synthesizers (i.e., part of the closed set)
and others to be ""unknown"" synthesizers (i.e., part of the open set). We
represent speech signals as spectrograms and train our proposed method, known
as compact attribution transformer (CAT), on the closed set for multi-class
classification. Then, we extend our analysis to the open set to attribute
synthesized speech signals to both known and unknown synthesizers. We utilize a
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) on the latent space of the
trained CAT to differentiate between each unknown synthesizer. Additionally, we
explore poly-1 loss formulations to improve attribution results. Our proposed
approach successfully attributes synthesized speech signals to their respective
speech synthesizers in both closed and open set scenarios.","['Emily R. Bartusiak', 'Edward J. Delp']",11,0.5807086
"Recent years have witnessed the rise of misinformation campaigns that spread
specific narratives on social media to manipulate public opinions on different

of temporal point process. To adapt the large-scale data, we design an
efficient yet precise way to estimate the Individual Treatment Effect(ITE) via
neural temporal point process and gaussian mixture models. Extensive

"The widespread diffusion of medical and political claims in the wake of
COVID-19 has led to a voluminous rise in misinformation and fake news. The

"In the real-world application of COVID-19 misinformation detection, a
fundamental challenge is the lack of the labeled COVID data to enable

adaptation framework using contrastive learning and adversarial domain mixup to
transfer the knowledge from an existing source data domain to the target
COVID-19 data domain. In particular, to bridge the gap between the source
domain and the target domain, our method reduces a radial basis function (RBF)
based discrepancy between these two domains. Moreover, we leverage the power of
domain adversarial examples to establish an intermediate domain mixup, where
the latent representations of the input text from both domains could be mixed

image space. When posted online, these cloaked images can jeopardize the GAN
inversion process. We consider two state-of-the-art inversion techniques

"As social media becomes a hotbed for the spread of misinformation, the
crucial task of rumor detection has witnessed promising advances fostered by
open-source benchmark datasets. Despite being widely used, we find that these
datasets suffer from spurious correlations, which are ignored by existing
studies and lead to severe overestimation of existing rumor detection
performance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based
data collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple
highly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data
sources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3)
labeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular
rumor detection benchmark datasets (i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16 and PHEME), and
propose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious
cues. Under the event-separated setting, we observe that the accuracy of
existing state-of-the-art models drops significantly by over 40%, becoming only
comparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we

"Recent advances in artificial speech and audio technologies have improved the
abilities of deep-fake operators to falsify media and spread malicious
misinformation. Anyone with limited coding skills can use freely available

With the latest technology, malicious operators do not have to generate an

"Multiple-objective optimization (MOO) aims to simultaneously optimize
multiple conflicting objectives and has found important applications in machine
learning, such as minimizing classification loss and discrepancy in treating
different populations for fairness. At optimality, further optimizing one
objective will necessarily harm at least another objective, and decision-makers
need to comprehensively explore multiple optima (called Pareto front) to
pinpoint one final solution. We address the efficiency of finding the Pareto
front. First, finding the front from scratch using stochastic multi-gradient
descent (SMGD) is expensive with large neural networks and datasets. We propose
to explore the Pareto front as a manifold from a few initial optima, based on a
predictor-corrector method. Second, for each exploration step, the predictor
solves a large-scale linear system that scales quadratically in the number of
model parameters and requires one backpropagation to evaluate a second-order
Hessian-vector product per iteration of the solver. We propose a Gauss-Newton
approximation that only scales linearly, and that requires only first-order
inner-product per iteration. This also allows for a choice between the MINRES
and conjugate gradient methods when approximately solving the linear system.
The innovations make predictor-corrector possible for large networks.
Experiments on multi-objective (fairness and accuracy) misinformation detection
tasks show that 1) the predictor-corrector method can find Pareto fronts better
than or similar to SMGD with less time; and 2) the proposed first-order method
does not harm the quality of the Pareto front identified by the second-order
method, while further reduce running time.","['Eric Enouen', 'Katja Mathesius', 'Sean Wang', 'Arielle Carr', 'Sihong Xie']",2,0.71829045

that vaccination rates among this minority group are negatively correlated with

"Social media platforms have become new battlegrounds for anti-social
elements, with misinformation being the weapon of choice. Fact-checking
organizations try to debunk as many claims as possible while staying true to
their journalistic processes but cannot cope with its rapid dissemination. We
believe that the solution lies in partial automation of the fact-checking life
cycle, saving human time for tasks which require high cognition. We propose a
new workflow for efficiently detecting previously fact-checked claims that uses
abstractive summarization to generate crisp queries. These queries can then be
executed on a general-purpose retrieval system associated with a collection of
previously fact-checked claims. We curate an abstractive text summarization
dataset comprising noisy claims from Twitter and their gold summaries. It is
shown that retrieval performance improves 2x by using popular out-of-the-box
summarization models and 3x by fine-tuning them on the accompanying dataset
compared to verbatim querying. Our approach achieves Recall@5 and MRR of 35%
and 0.3, compared to baseline values of 10% and 0.1, respectively. Our dataset,

"Following recent outbreaks, monkeypox-related misinformation continues to
rapidly spread online. This negatively impacts response strategies and
disproportionately harms LGBTQ+ communities in the short-term, and ultimately
undermines the overall effectiveness of public health responses. In an attempt
to combat monkeypox-related misinformation, we present PoxVerifi, an
open-source, extensible tool that provides a comprehensive approach to
assessing the accuracy of monkeypox related claims. Leveraging information from
existing fact checking sources and published World Health Organization (WHO)
information, we created an open-sourced corpus of 225 rated monkeypox claims.
Additionally, we trained an open-sourced BERT-based machine learning model for
specifically classifying monkeypox information, which achieved 96%

designed to empower users to navigate through monkeypox-related misinformation.
Specifically, PoxVerifi provides users with a comprehensive toolkit to assess
the veracity of headlines on any webpage across the Internet without having to
visit an external site. Users can view an automated accuracy review from our
trained machine learning model, a user-generated accuracy review based on
community-member votes, and have the ability to see similar, vetted, claims.

"COVID-19 impacted every part of the world, although the misinformation about
the outbreak traveled faster than the virus. Misinformation spread through
online social networks (OSN) often misled people from following correct medical
practices. In particular, OSN bots have been a primary source of disseminating
false information and initiating cyber propaganda. Existing work neglects the
presence of bots that act as a catalyst in the spread and focuses on fake news
detection in 'articles shared in posts' rather than the post (textual) content.
Most work on misinformation detection uses manually labeled datasets that are
hard to scale for building their predictive models. In this research, we
overcome this challenge of data scarcity by proposing an automated approach for
labeling data using verified fact-checked statements on a Twitter dataset. In
addition, we combine textual features with user-level features (such as
followers count and friends count) and tweet-level features (such as number of
mentions, hashtags and urls in a tweet) to act as additional indicators to
detect misinformation. Moreover, we analyzed the presence of bots in tweets and
show that bots change their behavior over time and are most active during the
misinformation campaign. We collected 10.22 Million COVID-19 related tweets and
used our annotation model to build an extensive and original ground truth
dataset for classification purposes. We utilize various machine learning models
to accurately detect misinformation and our best classification model achieves
precision (82%), recall (96%), and false positive rate (3.58%). Also, our bot
analysis indicates that bots generated approximately 10% of misinformation
tweets. Our methodology results in substantial exposure of false information,

"Mis- and disinformation are a substantial global threat to our security and
safety. To cope with the scale of online misinformation, researchers have been
working on automating fact-checking by retrieving and verifying against
relevant evidence. However, despite many advances, a comprehensive evaluation
of the possible attack vectors against such systems is still lacking.
Particularly, the automated fact-verification process might be vulnerable to
the exact disinformation campaigns it is trying to combat. In this work, we
assume an adversary that automatically tampers with the online evidence in
order to disrupt the fact-checking model via camouflaging the relevant evidence
or planting a misleading one. We first propose an exploratory taxonomy that
spans these two targets and the different threat model dimensions. Guided by
this, we design and propose several potential attack methods. We show that it
is possible to subtly modify claim-salient snippets in the evidence and
generate diverse and claim-aligned evidence. Thus, we highly degrade the
fact-checking performance under many different permutations of the taxonomy's
dimensions. The attacks are also robust against post-hoc modifications of the
claim. Our analysis further hints at potential limitations in models' inference
when faced with contradicting evidence. We emphasize that these attacks can
have harmful implications on the inspectable and human-in-the-loop usage
scenarios of such models, and we conclude by discussing challenges and

"Today, participating in discussions on online forums is extremely commonplace
and these discussions have started rendering a strong influence on the overall
opinion of online users. Naturally, twisting the flow of the argument can have
a strong impact on the minds of naive users, which in the long run might have
socio-political ramifications, for example, winning an election or spreading
targeted misinformation. Thus, these platforms are potentially highly
vulnerable to malicious players who might act individually or as a cohort to
breed fallacious arguments with a motive to sway public opinion. Ad hominem
arguments are one of the most effective forms of such fallacies. Although a
simple fallacy, it is effective enough to sway public debates in offline world
and can be used as a precursor to shutting down the voice of opposition by

  In this work, we take a first step in shedding light on the usage of ad
hominem fallacies in the wild. First, we build a powerful ad hominem detector
with high accuracy (F1 more than 83%, showing a significant improvement over

small fraction. We then used our detector on 265k arguments collected from the
online debate forum - CreateDebate. Our crowdsourced surveys validate our
in-the-wild predictions on CreateDebate data (94% match with manual
annotation). Our analysis revealed that a surprising 31.23% of CreateDebate
content contains ad hominem fallacy, and a cohort of highly active users post
significantly more ad hominem to suppress opposing views. Then, our temporal
analysis revealed that ad hominem argument usage increased significantly since
the 2016 US Presidential election, not only for topics like Politics, but also
for Science and Law. We conclude by discussing important implications of our

on Twitter during 2021, when vaccines were being released to the public in an
effort to mitigate the global pandemic. Our findings show a low prevalence of
low-credibility information compared to mainstream news. However, most popular
low-credibility sources had larger reshare volumes than authoritative sources
such as the CDC and WHO. We observed an increasing trend in the prevalence of
low-credibility news relative to mainstream news about vaccines. We also
observed a considerable amount of suspicious YouTube videos shared on Twitter.

likely to be shared by automated accounts. Our findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that superspreaders are driven by financial incentives that allow
them to profit from health misinformation. Despite high-profile cases of
deplatformed misinformation superspreaders, our results show that in 2021 a few

capture the local relation. Besides, we retain the global topological structure
information by maximizing the mutual information (MI) of the whole graph and
feature embeddings, which is theoretically reduced to exchanging the feature
embeddings of the feature and the original graphs to reconstruct themselves.

"""Emergence"", the phenomenon where a complex system displays properties,
behaviours, or dynamics not trivially reducible to its constituent elements, is
one of the defining properties of complex systems. Recently, there has been a
concerted effort to formally define emergence using the mathematical framework
of information theory, which proposes that emergence can be understood in terms
of how the states of wholes and parts collectively disclose information about
the system's collective future. In this paper, we show how a common,
foundational component of information-theoretic approaches to emergence implies
an inherent instability to emergent properties, which we call flickering
emergence. A system may on average display a meaningful emergent property (be
it an informative coarse-graining, or higher-order synergy), but for particular
configurations, that emergent property falls apart and becomes misinformative.
We show existence proofs that flickering emergence occurs in two different
frameworks (one based on coarse-graining and another based on multivariate
information decomposition) and argue that any approach based on temporal mutual
information will display it. Finally, we argue that flickering emergence should
not be a disqualifying property of any model of emergence, but that it should
be accounted for when attempting to theorize about how emergence relates to
practical models of the natural world.",['Thomas F. Varley'],2,0.65997624

"Some political strategies to win elections over the last years were based
heavily on fomenting general distrust in information institutions and favoring
distrustful sources. The misinformation pandemic has the straightforward
consequence that people do not believe any information unless it is compatible
with their own beliefs. We present a simple model to study the emergence of
consensus in opinion pools of uncertain agents that trust (couple to) their
neighbors (information sources) with strength K. We focus the studies on
regular lattices and linear coupling. Depending on the coupling constant, K,
and the propensity to choose an opinion (the probability to manifest a given
opinion in solitude), p_0, we get regions where consensus is surely reached
even in infinity systems (K greater than or equal to K_c), regions where
not-consensus is the only steady state (K lesser than K_c), and a region where
consensus on any opinion is transitory with each agent presenting periods of
strong oscillation of opinions before changing polarization (p_0 equal to p_c
and K greater than or equal K_c. The first model in this last region presents
transition probabilities identical to the voter model (p_0 equal to p_c and K
equal to K_c). Different upbringings, exposition to education biased to a
single political view, and previous coexistence with opinion polarized people
can change the opinion of agents in isolation. We model such characteristics
with heterogeneous populations (p^i_0 not equal to p^j_0 for some pairs of
nodes i,j). Such systems present regions where the coexistence of local
consensus (bulk-stable clusters of like-minded opinions), weak consensus
(bulk-unstable temporary clusters where contrary opinions emerge inside the

"Despite recent progress in improving the performance of misinformation
detection systems, classifying misinformation in an unseen domain remains an
elusive challenge. To address this issue, a common approach is to introduce a
domain critic and encourage domain-invariant input features. However, early
misinformation often demonstrates both conditional and label shifts against
existing misinformation data (e.g., class imbalance in COVID-19 datasets),
rendering such methods less effective for detecting early misinformation. In
this paper, we propose contrastive adaptation network for early misinformation
detection (CANMD). Specifically, we leverage pseudo labeling to generate
high-confidence target examples for joint training with source data. We
additionally design a label correction component to estimate and correct the
label shifts (i.e., class priors) between the source and target domains.
Moreover, a contrastive adaptation loss is integrated in the objective function
to reduce the intra-class discrepancy and enlarge the inter-class discrepancy.
As such, the adapted model learns corrected class priors and an invariant
conditional distribution across both domains for improved estimation of the
target data distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
CANMD, we study the case of COVID-19 early misinformation detection and perform
extensive experiments using multiple real-world datasets. The results suggest
that CANMD can effectively adapt misinformation detection systems to the unseen

"Twitter bots are automatic programs operated by malicious actors to
manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. Research efforts have been
made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social
media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few
works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize
that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be
crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In
addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are
constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute
their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater
inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more
attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot
detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency.
Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social
media, BIC employs a text-graph interaction module to enable information
exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the
stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic
consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the

"In the recent years, social media has grown to become a major source of
information for many online users. This has given rise to the spread of
misinformation through deepfakes. Deepfakes are videos or images that replace
one persons face with another computer-generated face, often a more
recognizable person in society. With the recent advances in technology, a
person with little technological experience can generate these videos. This
enables them to mimic a power figure in society, such as a president or
celebrity, creating the potential danger of spreading misinformation and other
nefarious uses of deepfakes. To combat this online threat, researchers have
developed models that are designed to detect deepfakes. This study looks at
various deepfake detection models that use deep learning algorithms to combat
this looming threat. This survey focuses on providing a comprehensive overview
of the current state of deepfake detection models and the unique approaches
many researchers take to solving this problem. The benefits, limitations, and
suggestions for future work will be thoroughly discussed throughout this paper.","['Jacob Mallet', 'Rushit Dave', 'Naeem Seliya', 'Mounika Vanamala']",11,0.8403803
"As tools for content editing mature, and artificial intelligence (AI) based
algorithms for synthesizing media grow, the presence of manipulated content
across online media is increasing. This phenomenon causes the spread of
misinformation, creating a greater need to distinguish between ``real'' and
``manipulated'' content. To this end, we present VideoSham, a dataset
consisting of 826 videos (413 real and 413 manipulated). Many of the existing
deepfake datasets focus exclusively on two types of facial manipulations --
swapping with a different subject's face or altering the existing face.
VideoSham, on the other hand, contains more diverse, context-rich, and
human-centric, high-resolution videos manipulated using a combination of 6
different spatial and temporal attacks. Our analysis shows that
state-of-the-art manipulation detection algorithms only work for a few specific
attacks and do not scale well on VideoSham. We performed a user study on Amazon
Mechanical Turk with 1200 participants to understand if they can differentiate
between the real and manipulated videos in VideoSham. Finally, we dig deeper
into the strengths and weaknesses of performances by humans and SOTA-algorithms
to identify gaps that need to be filled with better AI algorithms. We present

"In this paper we investigate what folk models of misinformation exist through
semi-structured interviews with a sample of 235 social media users. Work on
social media misinformation does not investigate how ordinary users - the
target of misinformation - deal with it; rather, the focus is mostly on the
anxiety, tensions, or divisions misinformation creates. Studying the aspects of
creation, diffusion and amplification also overlooks how misinformation is
internalized by users on social media and thus is quick to prescribe
""inoculation"" strategies for the presumed lack of immunity to misinformation.
How users grapple with social media content to develop ""natural immunity"" as a
precursor to misinformation resilience remains an open question. We have
identified at least five folk models that conceptualize misinformation as
either: political (counter)argumentation, out-of-context narratives, inherently
fallacious information, external propaganda, or simply entertainment. We use
the rich conceptualizations embodied in these folk models to uncover how social
media users minimize adverse reactions to misinformation encounters in their
everyday lives.","['Filipo Sharevski', 'Amy Devine', 'Emma Pieroni', 'Peter Jachim']",3,0.76471305
"The Covid-19 pandemic has sparked renewed attention on the prevalence of
misinformation online, whether intentional or not, underscoring the potential
risks posed to individuals' quality of life associated with the dissemination
of misconceptions and enduring myths on health-related subjects. In this study,
we analyze 6 years (2016-2021) of Italian vaccine debate across diverse social
media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), encompassing all major
news sources - both questionable and reliable. We first use the symbolic
transfer entropy analysis of news production time-series to dynamically
determine which category of sources, questionable or reliable, causally drives
the agenda on vaccines. Then, leveraging deep learning models capable to
accurately classify vaccine-related content based on the conveyed stance and
discussed topic, respectively, we evaluate the focus on various topics by news
sources promoting opposing views and compare the resulting user engagement.
Aside from providing valuable resources for further investigation of
vaccine-related misinformation, particularly in a language (Italian) that
receives less attention in scientific research compared to languages like
English, our study uncovers misinformation not as a parasite of the news
ecosystem that merely opposes the perspectives offered by mainstream media, but
as an autonomous force capable of even overwhelming the production of
vaccine-related content from the latter. While the pervasiveness of
misinformation is evident in the significantly higher engagement of
questionable sources compared to reliable ones, our findings underscore the
importance of consistent and thorough pro-vax coverage. This is especially
crucial in addressing the most sensitive topics where the risk of
misinformation spreading and potentially exacerbating negative attitudes toward
vaccines among the users involved is higher.","['Emanuele Brugnoli', 'Marco Delmastro']",12,0.8305241
"Online social network platforms have a problem with misinformation. One
popular way of addressing this problem is via the use of machine learning based
automated misinformation detection systems to classify if a post is
misinformation. Instead of post hoc detection, we propose to predict if a user
will engage with misinformation in advance and design an effective graph neural
network classifier based on ego-graphs for this task. However, social networks
are highly dynamic, reflecting continual changes in user behaviour, as well as
the content being posted. This is problematic for machine learning models which
are typically trained on a static training dataset, and can thus become
outdated when the social network changes. Inspired by the success of continual
learning on such problems, we propose an ego-graphs replay strategy in
continual learning (EgoCL) using graph neural networks to effectively address
this issue. We have evaluated the performance of our method on user engagement
with misinformation on two Twitter datasets across nineteen misinformation and
conspiracy topics. Our experimental results show that our approach EgoCL has
better performance in terms of predictive accuracy and computational resources
than the state of the art.","['Hongbo Bo', 'Ryan McConville', 'Jun Hong', 'Weiru Liu']",2,0.6739161

"Facial forgery by deepfakes has raised severe societal concerns. Several
solutions have been proposed by the vision community to effectively combat the
misinformation on the internet via automated deepfake detection systems. Recent
studies have demonstrated that facial analysis-based deep learning models can
discriminate based on protected attributes. For the commercial adoption and
massive roll-out of the deepfake detection technology, it is vital to evaluate
and understand the fairness (the absence of any prejudice or favoritism) of
deepfake detectors across demographic variations such as gender and race. As
the performance differential of deepfake detectors between demographic
subgroups would impact millions of people of the deprived sub-group. This paper
aims to evaluate the fairness of the deepfake detectors across males and
females. However, existing deepfake datasets are not annotated with demographic
labels to facilitate fairness analysis. To this aim, we manually annotated
existing popular deepfake datasets with gender labels and evaluated the
performance differential of current deepfake detectors across gender. Our
analysis on the gender-labeled version of the datasets suggests (a) current
deepfake datasets have skewed distribution across gender, and (b) commonly
adopted deepfake detectors obtain unequal performance across gender with mostly
males outperforming females. Finally, we contributed a gender-balanced and
annotated deepfake dataset, GBDF, to mitigate the performance differential and
to promote research and development towards fairness-aware deep fake detectors.

"The world's digital information ecosystem continues to struggle with the
spread of misinformation. Prior work has suggested that users who consistently
disseminate a disproportionate amount of low-credibility content -- so-called
superspreaders -- are at the center of this problem. We quantitatively confirm
this hypothesis and introduce simple metrics to predict the top superspreaders
several months into the future. We then conduct a qualitative review to
characterize the most prolific superspreaders and analyze their sharing
behaviors. Superspreaders include pundits with large followings,
low-credibility media outlets, personal accounts affiliated with those media
outlets, and a range of influencers. They are primarily political in nature and
use more toxic language than the typical user sharing misinformation. We also
find concerning evidence that suggests Twitter may be overlooking prominent
superspreaders. We hope this work will further public understanding of bad

and physiology modalities, either by augmenting the video with information from
the physiology or by novelly learning the fusion of those two modalities with a
proposed Graph Convolutional Network architecture. Both strategies for
combining the two modalities rely on a novel method for generation of visual

"Unlike traditional media, social media typically provides quantified metrics
of how many users have engaged with each piece of content. Some have argued
that the presence of these cues promotes the spread of misinformation. Here we
investigate the causal effect of social cues on users' engagement with social
media posts. We conducted an experiment with N=628 Americans on a custom-built
newsfeed interface where we systematically varied the presence and strength of
social cues. We find that when cues are shown, indicating that a larger number
of others have engaged with a post, users were more likely to share and like
that post. Furthermore, relative to a control without social cues, the presence
of social cues increased the sharing of true relative to false news. The
presence of social cues also makes it more difficult to precisely predict how
popular any given post would be. Together, our results suggest that -- instead
of distracting users or causing them to share low-quality news -- social cues
may, in certain circumstances, actually boost truth discernment and reduce the
sharing of misinformation. Our work suggests that social cues play important
roles in shaping users' attention and engagement on social media, and platforms
should understand the effects of different cues before making changes to what
cues are displayed and how.","['Ziv Epstein', 'Hause Lin', 'Gordon Pennycook', 'David Rand']",3,0.70735025
"RGB-D SOD uses depth information to handle challenging scenes and obtain
high-quality saliency maps. Existing state-of-the-art RGB-D saliency detection
methods overwhelmingly rely on the strategy of directly fusing depth
information. Although these methods improve the accuracy of saliency prediction
through various cross-modality fusion strategies, misinformation provided by
some poor-quality depth images can affect the saliency prediction result. To
address this issue, a novel RGB-D salient object detection model (SiaTrans) is
proposed in this paper, which allows training on depth image quality
classification at the same time as training on SOD. In light of the common
information between RGB and depth images on salient objects, SiaTrans uses a
Siamese transformer network with shared weight parameters as the encoder and
extracts RGB and depth features concatenated on the batch dimension, saving
space resources without compromising performance. SiaTrans uses the Class token
in the backbone network (T2T-ViT) to classify the quality of depth images
without preventing the token sequence from going on with the saliency detection
task. Transformer-based cross-modality fusion module (CMF) can effectively fuse
RGB and depth information. And in the testing process, CMF can choose to fuse
cross-modality information or enhance RGB information according to the quality
classification signal of the depth image. The greatest benefit of our designed
CMF and decoder is that they maintain the consistency of RGB and RGB-D
information decoding: SiaTrans decodes RGB-D or RGB information under the same
model parameters according to the classification signal during testing.
Comprehensive experiments on nine RGB-D SOD benchmark datasets show that
SiaTrans has the best overall performance and the least computation compared
with recent state-of-the-art methods.","['Xingzhao Jia', 'Dongye Changlei', 'Yanjun Peng']",7,0.6257539

"Previous work suggests that people's preference for different kinds of
information depends on more than just accuracy. This could happen because the
messages contained within different pieces of information may either be
well-liked or repulsive. Whereas factual information must often convey
uncomfortable truths, misinformation can have little regard for veracity and
leverage psychological processes which increase its attractiveness and
proliferation on social media. In this review, we argue that when
misinformation proliferates, this happens because the social media environment
enables adherence to misinformation by reducing, rather than increasing, the
psychological cost of doing so. We cover how attention may often be shifted
away from accuracy and towards other goals, how social and individual cognition
is affected by misinformation and the cases under which debunking it is most
effective, and how the formation of online groups affects information
consumption patterns, often leading to more polarization and radicalization.
Throughout, we make the case that polarization and misinformation adherence are
closely tied. We identify ways in which the psychological cost of adhering to
misinformation can be increased when designing anti-misinformation
interventions or resilient affordances, and we outline open research questions
that the CSCW community can take up in further understanding this cost.","['Alexandros Efstratiou', 'Emiliano De Cristofaro']",0,0.75723994

Time-trend analysis was employed to understand popularity trends and related
events. Content and demographic analyses were conducted to explore potential
rationales behind people's stances on each drug. Time-trend analysis indicated
that Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin were discussed more than Molnupiravir

to minimize the number of users that adopt misinformation propagating through a

employ a sandwiching technique by defining submodular upper and lower bounding
functions, providing data-dependent guarantees. In order to enable the use of a
reverse sampling framework, we introduce a weighted version of reverse
reachability sets that captures the associated differential propagation rates
and establish a key equivalence between weighted set coverage probabilities and
mitigation with respect to the sandwiching functions. Further, we propose an

"Localizing the source of graph diffusion phenomena, such as misinformation
propagation, is an important yet extremely challenging task. Existing source
localization models typically are heavily dependent on the hand-crafted rules.
Unfortunately, a large portion of the graph diffusion process for many
applications is still unknown to human beings so it is important to have
expressive models for learning such underlying rules automatically. This paper
aims to establish a generic framework of invertible graph diffusion models for
source localization on graphs, namely Invertible Validity-aware Graph Diffusion
(IVGD), to handle major challenges including 1) Difficulty to leverage
knowledge in graph diffusion models for modeling their inverse processes in an
end-to-end fashion, 2) Difficulty to ensure the validity of the inferred
sources, and 3) Efficiency and scalability in source inference. Specifically,
first, to inversely infer sources of graph diffusion, we propose a graph
residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible with
theoretical guarantees; second, we develop a novel error compensation mechanism
that learns to offset the errors of the inferred sources. Finally, to ensure
the validity of the inferred sources, a new set of validity-aware layers have
been devised to project inferred sources to feasible regions by flexibly
encoding constraints with unrolled optimization techniques. A linearization
technique is proposed to strengthen the efficiency of our proposed layers. The

action potential output by apical dendritic input and its regulation by
dendritic inhibition. We find that two of the decompositions produce much
larger estimates of synergy and shared information than the others, as well as
large levels of unique misinformation. When within-neuron differences in the
components are examined, the five methods produce more similar results for all
but the shared information component, for which two methods produce a different
statistical conclusion from the others. There are some differences in the
expression of unique information asymmetry among the methods. It is
significantly larger, on average, under dendritic inhibition. Three of the
methods support a previous conclusion that apical amplification is reduced by
dendritic inhibition. The second study used a detailed compartmental model to
produce action potentials for many combinations of the numbers of basal and
apical synaptic inputs. Two analyses of decompositions are conducted on subsets
of the data. In the first, the decompositions reveal a bifurcation in unique
information asymmetry. For three of the methods this suggests that apical drive
switches to basal drive as the strength of the basal input increases, while the
other two show changing mixtures of information and misinformation.

"To curb the spread of fake news on social media platforms, recent studies
have considered an online crowdsourcing fact-checking approach as one possible

as `peer policing' that will reduce the perceived payoff to share or
disseminate false information (fake news) and also reward the spread of
trustworthy information (real news). By simulating our model on synthetic
square lattices and small-world networks, we show that the presence of social
network structure enables fake news spreaders to be self-organized into echo
chambers, thereby providing a boost to the efficacy of fake news and thus its
resistance to fact-checking efforts. Additionally, to study our model in a more

effectiveness of deliberately choosing specific individuals to be

effective, seeing the same level of success with as little as a fifth of the

and tools available in other languages, such as Chinese, are limited. In order
to bridge this gap, we construct CHEF, the first CHinese Evidence-based
Fact-checking dataset of 10K real-world claims. The dataset covers multiple
domains, ranging from politics to public health, and provides annotated
evidence retrieved from the Internet. Further, we develop established baselines
and a novel approach that is able to model the evidence retrieval as a latent
variable, allowing jointly training with the veracity prediction model in an
end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments show that CHEF will provide a
challenging testbed for the development of fact-checking systems designed to
retrieve and reason over non-English claims.","['Xuming Hu', 'Zhijiang Guo', 'Guanyu Wu', 'Aiwei Liu', 'Lijie Wen', 'Philip S. Yu']",8,0.78665495
"With recent progress in deep generative models, the problem of identifying
synthetic data and comparing their underlying generative processes has become
an imperative task for various reasons, including fighting visual
misinformation and source attribution. Existing methods often approximate the
distance between the models via their sample distributions. In this paper, we
approach the problem of fingerprinting generative models by learning
representations that encode the residual artifacts left by the generative
models as unique signals that identify the source models. We consider these
unique traces (a.k.a. ""artificial fingerprints"") as representations of
generative models, and demonstrate their usefulness in both the discriminative
task of source attribution and the unsupervised task of defining a similarity
between the underlying models. We first extend the existing studies on
fingerprints of GANs to four representative classes of generative models (VAEs,
Flows, GANs and score-based models), and demonstrate their existence and
attributability. We then improve the stability and attributability of the
fingerprints by proposing a new learning method based on set-encoding and
contrastive training. Our set-encoder, unlike existing methods that operate on
individual images, learns fingerprints from a \textit{set} of images. We
demonstrate improvements in the stability and attributability through
comparisons to state-of-the-art fingerprint methods and ablation studies.
Further, our method employs contrastive training to learn an implicit
similarity between models. We discover latent families of generative models
using this metric in a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm.","['Hae Jin Song', 'Wael AbdAlmageed']",7,0.7699108
"Deepfakes pose a serious threat to digital well-being by fueling
misinformation. As deepfakes get harder to recognize with the naked eye, human
users become increasingly reliant on deepfake detection models to decide if a
video is real or fake. Currently, models yield a prediction for a video's
authenticity, but do not integrate a method for alerting a human user. We
introduce a framework for amplifying artifacts in deepfake videos to make them
more detectable by people. We propose a novel, semi-supervised Artifact
Attention module, which is trained on human responses to create attention maps
that highlight video artifacts. These maps make two contributions. First, they
improve the performance of our deepfake detection classifier. Second, they
allow us to generate novel ""Deepfake Caricatures"": transformations of the
deepfake that exacerbate artifacts to improve human detection. In a user study,
we demonstrate that Caricatures greatly increase human detection, across video
presentation times and user engagement levels. Overall, we demonstrate the
success of a human-centered approach to designing deepfake mitigation methods.","['Camilo Fosco', 'Emilie Josephs', 'Alex Andonian', 'Allen Lee', 'Xi Wang', 'Aude Oliva']",11,0.81384283

that improving the filter's quality is weakly Pareto improving, but has no
impact on equilibrium payoffs until the filter becomes sufficiently accurate.

"The spread of misinformation on social media is a pressing societal problem
that platforms, policymakers, and researchers continue to grapple with. As a
countermeasure, recent works have proposed to employ non-expert fact-checkers
in the crowd to fact-check social media content. While experimental studies
suggest that crowds might be able to accurately assess the veracity of social
media content, an understanding of how crowd fact-checked (mis-)information
spreads is missing. In this work, we empirically analyze the spread of
misleading vs. not misleading community fact-checked posts on social media. For
this purpose, we employ a dataset of community-created fact-checks from
Twitter's Birdwatch pilot and map them to resharing cascades on Twitter.
Different from earlier studies analyzing the spread of misinformation listed on
third-party fact-checking websites (e.g., Snopes), we find that community
fact-checked misinformation is less viral. Specifically, misleading posts are
estimated to receive 36.62% fewer retweets than not misleading posts. A partial
explanation may lie in differences in the fact-checking targets: community
fact-checkers tend to fact-check posts from influential user accounts with many
followers, while expert fact-checks tend to target posts that are shared by
less influential users. We further find that there are significant differences
in virality across different sub-types of misinformation (e.g., factual errors,
missing context, manipulated media). Moreover, we conduct a user study to
assess the perceived reliability of (real-world) community-created fact-checks.
Here, we find that users, to a large extent, agree with community-created
fact-checks. Altogether, our findings offer insights into how misleading vs.
not misleading posts spread and highlight the crucial role of sample selection
when studying misinformation on social media.","['Chiara Drolsbach', 'Nicolas Pröllochs']",3,0.792948

focused on verifying factual claims by retrieving evidence. However, canonical
fact verification tasks do not apply to catching subtle differences in
factually consistent claims, which might still bias the readers, especially on
contentious political or economic issues. Our underlying assumption is that
among the trusted sources, one's argument is not necessarily more true than the
other, requiring comparison rather than verification. In this study, we propose
ClaimDiff, a novel dataset that primarily focuses on comparing the nuance
between claim pairs. In ClaimDiff, we provide 2,941 annotated claim pairs from
268 news articles. We observe that while humans are capable of detecting the

"Past research has attributed the online circulation of misinformation to two
main factors - individual characteristics (e.g., a person's information
literacy) and social media effects (e.g., algorithm-mediated information
diffusion) - and has overlooked a third one: the critical mass created by the
offline self-segregation of Americans into like-minded geographical regions
such as states (a phenomenon called ""The Big Sort""). We hypothesized that this
latter factor matters for the online spreading of misinformation not least
because online interactions, despite having the potential of being global, end
up being localized: interaction probability is known to rapidly decay with
distance. Upon analysis of more than 8M Reddit comments containing news links
spanning four years, from January 2016 to December 2019, we found that Reddit
did not work as an ""hype machine"" for misinformation (as opposed to what
previous work reported for other platforms, circulation was not mainly caused
by platform-facilitated network effects) but worked as a supply-and-demand
system: misinformation news items scaled linearly with the number of users in
each state (with a scaling exponent beta=1, and a goodness of fit R2 = 0.95).
Furthermore, deviations from such a universal pattern were best explained by
state-level personality and cultural factors (R2 = {0.12, 0.39}), rather than
socioeconomic conditions (R2 = {0.15, 0.29}) or, as one would expect, political
characteristics (R2 ={0.06, 0.21}). Higher-than-expected circulation of any
type of news (including reputable news) was found in states characterised by
residents who tend to be less diligent in terms of their personality (low in
conscientiousness) and by loose cultures understating the importance of
adherence to norms (low in cultural tightness).","['Lia Bozarth', 'Daniele Quercia', 'Licia Capra', 'Sanja Scepanovic']",3,0.6883019
"COVID-19 related misinformation and fake news, coined an 'infodemic', has
dramatically increased over the past few years. This misinformation exhibits
concept drift, where the distribution of fake news changes over time, reducing
effectiveness of previously trained models for fake news detection. Given a set
of fake news models trained on multiple domains, we propose an adaptive
decision module to select the best-fit model for a new sample. We propose
MiDAS, a multi-domain adaptative approach for fake news detection that ranks
relevancy of existing models to new samples. MiDAS contains 2 components: a
doman-invariant encoder, and an adaptive model selector. MiDAS integrates
multiple pre-trained and fine-tuned models with their training data to create a
domain-invariant representation. Then, MiDAS uses local Lipschitz smoothness of
the invariant embedding space to estimate each model's relevance to a new
sample. Higher ranked models provide predictions, and lower ranked models
abstain. We evaluate MiDAS on generalization to drifted data with 9 fake news
datasets, each obtained from different domains and modalities. MiDAS achieves
new state-of-the-art performance on multi-domain adaptation for
out-of-distribution fake news classification.","['Abhijit Suprem', 'Calton Pu']",2,0.63666654
"The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by an `infodemic' -- of accurate
and inaccurate health information across social media. Detecting misinformation
amidst dynamically changing information landscape is challenging; identifying
relevant keywords and posts is arduous due to the large amount of human effort
required to inspect the content and sources of posts. We aim to reduce the
resource cost of this process by introducing a weakly-supervised iterative
graph-based approach to detect keywords, topics, and themes related to
misinformation, with a focus on COVID-19. Our approach can successfully detect
specific topics from general misinformation-related seed words in a few seed
texts. Our approach utilizes the BERT-based Word Graph Search (BWGS) algorithm
that builds on context-based neural network embeddings for retrieving
misinformation-related posts. We utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
topic modeling for obtaining misinformation-related themes from the texts
returned by BWGS. Furthermore, we propose the BERT-based Multi-directional Word

"The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the spread of misinformation on social media
and the Web as a whole. The phenomenon dubbed `infodemic' has taken the
challenges of information veracity and trust to new heights by massively
introducing seemingly scientific and technical elements into misleading
content. Despite the existing body of work on modeling and predicting
misinformation, the coverage of very complex scientific topics with inherent
uncertainty and an evolving set of findings, such as COVID-19, provides many
new challenges that are not easily solved by existing tools. To address these
issues, we introduce SciLander, a method for learning representations of news
sources reporting on science-based topics. SciLander extracts four
heterogeneous indicators for the news sources; two generic indicators that
capture (1) the copying of news stories between sources, and (2) the use of the
same terms to mean different things (i.e., the semantic shift of terms), and
two scientific indicators that capture (1) the usage of jargon and (2) the
stance towards specific citations. We use these indicators as signals of source
agreement, sampling pairs of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar)
samples, and combine them in a unified framework to train unsupervised news
source embeddings with a triplet margin loss objective. We evaluate our method
on a novel COVID-19 dataset containing nearly 1M news articles from 500 sources
spanning a period of 18 months since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Our
results show that the features learned by our model outperform state-of-the-art

clustering analysis suggests that the learned representations encode
information about the reliability, political leaning, and partisanship bias of
these sources.","['Maurício Gruppi', 'Panayiotis Smeros', 'Sibel Adalı', 'Carlos Castillo', 'Karl Aberer']",4,0.7263701
"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic and parallel rise in dangerous
misinformation, denoted an `infodemic' by the CDC and WHO. Misinformation tied
to the Covid-19 infodemic changes continuously; this can lead to performance
degradation of fine-tuned models due to concept drift. Degredation can be
mitigated if models generalize well-enough to capture some cyclical aspects of
drifted data. In this paper, we explore generalizability of pre-trained and
fine-tuned fake news detectors across 9 fake news datasets. We show that
existing models often overfit on their training dataset and have poor
performance on unseen data. However, on some subsets of unseen data that
overlap with training data, models have higher accuracy. Based on this
observation, we also present KMeans-Proxy, a fast and effective method based on
K-Means clustering for quickly identifying these overlapping subsets of unseen

"The appearance of complex attention-based language models such as BERT,

powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this

"Motivated by recent works in the communication and psychology literature, we
model and study the role social identity -- a person's sense of belonging to a
group -- plays in human information consumption. A hallmark of Social Identity
Theory (SIT) is the notion of 'status', i.e., an individual's desire to enhance
their and their 'in-group's' utility relative to that of an 'out-group'. In the
context of belief formation, this comes off as a desire to believe positive
news about the in-group and negative news about the out-group, which has been
empirically shown to support belief in misinformation and false news.
  We model this phenomenon as a Stackelberg game being played over an
information channel between a news-source (sender) and news-consumer
(receiver), with the receiver incorporating the 'status' associated with social
identity in their utility, in addition to accuracy. We characterize the
strategy that must be employed by the sender to ensure that its message is
trusted by receivers of all identities while maximizing their overall quality
of information. We show that, as a rule, this optimal quality of information at
equilibrium decreases when a receiver's sense of identity increases. We further
demonstrate how extensions of our model can be used to quantitatively estimate
the level of importance given to identity in a population.","['Vijeth Hebbar', 'Cedric Langbort']",3,0.6275879

inadequate for characterizing attacker signatures. However, we also demonstrate
that embeddings from a recurrent neural network can successfully characterize
attacks from both known and unknown attackers. Our attack signature embeddings
result in distinct clusters, both for seen and unseen audio deepfakes. We show

"Recent social networks' misinformation mitigation approaches tend to
investigate how to reduce misinformation by considering a whole-network

a stochastic and non-stationary knapsack problem, and we apply its resolution
to mitigate misinformation in social network campaigns. We further propose a
generic misinformation mitigation algorithm that is robust to different social
networks' misinformation statistics, allowing a promising impact in real-world
scenarios. A novel loss function ensures fair mitigation among users. We
achieve fairness by intelligently allocating a mitigation incentivization
budget to the knapsack, and optimizing the loss function. To this end, a team

"Fake news detection is crucial for preventing the dissemination of

existing methods observe the language patterns of the news post and ""zoom in""

However, these methods neglect the information in the external news environment
where a fake news post is created and disseminated. The news environment
represents recent mainstream media opinion and public attention, which is an
important inspiration of fake news fabrication because fake news is often
designed to ride the wave of popular events and catch public attention with
unexpected novel content for greater exposure and spread. To capture the
environmental signals of news posts, we ""zoom out"" to observe the news
environment and propose the News Environment Perception Framework (NEP). For
each post, we construct its macro and micro news environment from recent

language patterns of fake-news sharers, highlighting elements such as their
higher use of anger and power-related words. In Study 2, we show that adding
textual cues into predictive models enhances their accuracy in predicting
fake-news sharers. In Study 3, we explore the contrasting role of trait and
situational anger, and show trait anger is associated with a greater propensity
to share both true and fake news. In Study 4, we introduce a way to
authenticate Twitter accounts in surveys, before using it to explore how

results for test domains with relevant but unseen data. The DANN-based model, a
traditional black-box model, cannot justify its outcome, i.e., the labels for

"Health misinformation is believed to have contributed to vaccine hesitancy
during the Covid-19 pandemic, highlighting concerns about the role of social
media in polarization and social stability. While previous research has
identified a link between political partisanship and misinformation sharing
online, the interaction between partisanship and how much misinformation people
see within their social networks has not been well studied. As a result, we do
not know whether partisanship drives exposure to misinformation or people
selectively share misinformation despite being exposed to factual content. We
study Twitter discussions about the Covid-19 pandemic, classifying users
ideologically along political and factual dimensions. We find partisan
asymmetries in both sharing behaviors and exposure, with conservatives more
likely to see and share misinformation and moderate liberals seeing the most
factual content. We identify multi-dimensional echo chambers that expose users
to ideologically congruent content; however, the interaction between political
and factual dimensions creates conditions for the highly polarized users --
hardline conservatives and liberals -- to amplify misinformation. Despite this,
misinformation receives less attention than factual content and political
moderates, who represent the bulk of users in our sample, help filter out
misinformation, reducing the amount of low factuality content in the
information ecosystem. Identifying the extent of polarization and how political
ideology can exacerbate misinformation can potentially help public health
experts and policy makers improve their messaging to promote consensus.","['Ashwin Rao', 'Fred Morstatter', 'Kristina Lerman']",3,0.774356

ideology: liberal vs. conservative) between-subjects online experiment (N =

for liberal users, all labels reduced the perceived accuracy and believability
of fake posts regardless of the posts' ideology. In contrast, for conservative
users, the efficacy of the labels depended on whether the posts were
ideologically consistent: algorithmic labels were more effective in reducing
the perceived accuracy and believability of fake conservative posts compared to
community labels, whereas all labels were effective in reducing their belief in
liberal posts. Our results shed light on the differing effects of various
misinformation labels dependent on people's political ideology.","['Chenyan Jia', 'Alexander Boltz', 'Angie Zhang', 'Anqing Chen', 'Min Kyung Lee']",3,0.60556626

"A core feature of complex systems is that the interactions between elements
in the present causally constrain each-other as the system evolves through
time. To fully model all of these interactions (between elements, as well as
ensembles of elements), we can decompose the total information flowing from
past to future into a set of non-overlapping temporal interactions that
describe all the different modes by which information can flow. To achieve
this, we propose a novel information-theoretic measure of temporal dependency
($I_{\tau sx}$) based on informative and misinformative local probability mass
exclusions. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we apply the
decomposition to spontaneous spiking activity recorded from dissociated neural
cultures of rat cerebral cortex to show how different modes of information
processing are distributed over the system. Furthermore, being a localizable
analysis, we show that $I_{\tau sx}$ can provide insight into the computational
structure of single moments. We explore the time-resolved computational
structure of neuronal avalanches and find that different types of information
atoms have distinct profiles over the course of an avalanche, with the majority
of non-trivial information dynamics happening before the first half of the
cascade is completed. These analyses allow us to move beyond the historical
focus on single measures of dependency such as information transfer or
information integration, and explore a panoply of different relationships

pre-registered randomized experiments with 2,215 participants to evaluate how
accurately humans distinguish real political speeches from fabrications across
base rates of misinformation, audio sources, question framings, and media
modalities. We find base rates of misinformation minimally influence
discernment and deepfakes with audio produced by the state-of-the-art
text-to-speech algorithms are harder to discern than the same deepfakes with
voice actor audio. Moreover across all experiments, we find audio and visual

"Image attribution -- matching an image back to a trusted source -- is an
emerging tool in the fight against online misinformation. Deep visual
fingerprinting models have recently been explored for this purpose. However,
they are not robust to tiny input perturbations known as adversarial examples.
First we illustrate how to generate valid adversarial images that can easily
cause incorrect image attribution. Then we describe an approach to prevent
imperceptible adversarial attacks on deep visual fingerprinting models, via
robust contrastive learning. The proposed training procedure leverages training
on $\ell_\infty$-bounded adversarial examples, it is conceptually simple and
incurs only a small computational overhead. The resulting models are
substantially more robust, are accurate even on unperturbed images, and perform
well even over a database with millions of images. In particular, we achieve
91.6% standard and 85.1% adversarial recall under $\ell_\infty$-bounded
perturbations on manipulated images compared to 80.1% and 0.0% from prior work.
We also show that robustness generalizes to other types of imperceptible
perturbations unseen during training. Finally, we show how to train an

"Malicious accounts spreading misinformation has led to widespread false and
misleading narratives in recent times, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and social media platforms struggle to eliminate these contents rapidly. This
is because adapting to new domains requires human intensive fact-checking that
is slow and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to
leverage news-source credibility labels as weak labels for social media posts
and propose model-guided refinement of labels to construct large-scale, diverse
misinformation labeled datasets in new domains. The weak labels can be
inaccurate at the article or social media post level where the stance of the
user does not align with the news source or article credibility. We propose a
framework to use a detection model self-trained on the initial weak labels with
uncertainty sampling based on entropy in predictions of the model to identify
potentially inaccurate labels and correct for them using self-supervision or
relabeling. The framework will incorporate social context of the post in terms
of the community of its associated user for surfacing inaccurate labels towards
building a large-scale dataset with minimum human effort. To provide labeled
datasets with distinction of misleading narratives where information might be
missing significant context or has inaccurate ancillary details, the proposed
framework will use the few labeled samples as class prototypes to separate high
confidence samples into false, unproven, mixture, mostly false, mostly true,
true, and debunk information. The approach is demonstrated for providing a
large-scale misinformation dataset on COVID-19 vaccines.","['Karishma Sharma', 'Emilio Ferrara', 'Yan Liu']",4,0.6830709

the moral emotions they carry. We observe that, on average, COVID-19
misinformation is more likely to go viral than truthful information. However,
the veracity effect is moderated by moral emotions: false rumors are more viral
than the truth if the source tweets embed a high number of other-condemning
emotion words, whereas a higher number of self-conscious emotion words is
linked to a less viral spread. The effects are pronounced both for health

engagement with remaining anti-vaccine content repeatedly recovered to
pre-policy levels, and this content became more misinformative, more
politically polarised, and more likely to be seen in users' newsfeeds. We

promoting community formation. Members of communities dedicated to vaccine

of agents is organized in a fixed network structure. There is a binary state of
the world and each agent receives a private signal on the state. We model
beliefs as urns where red balls represent one possible value of the state and
blue balls the other value. The model revolves purely around communication and
beliefs dynamics. Communication happens in discrete time and, at each period,
agents draw and display one ball from their urn with replacement. Then, they
reinforce their urns by adding balls of the colors drawn by their neighbors. We
show that for any network structure, this process converges almost-surely to a
stable state. Futher, we show that if the communication network is connected,
this stable state is such that all urns have the same proportion of balls. This
result strengthens the main convergence properties of non-Bayesian learning
models. Yet, contrary to those models, we show that this limit proportion is a
full-support random variable. This implies that an arbitrarily small proportion
of misinformed agents can substantially change the value of the limit

"People turn to search engines and social media to seek information during
population-level events, such as during civil unrest, disease outbreaks, fires,
or flood. They also tend to participate in discussions and disseminate
information and opinions via social media forums, and smartphone messaging
applications. COVID-19 pandemic was not any different. However, the proper
medical awareness and correct information dissemination is critical during a
pandemic. An unprecedented amount of internet traffic related to this topic was
generated during the start of the pandemic all over the world. In this work, we
have analysed the electronic data generated by users from Pakistan on Google
Search Engine and WhatsApp to understand their information-seeking behavior
during the first wave of the pandemic. The paper aims at analysing how the
Pakistani public developed their understanding about the disease, (its origin,
cures, and preventive measures to name a few) by analysing digital data. We
found that the public actively searched and discussed information at the start
of the pandemic. However, their interest waned with time and was reinvigorated
only when something novel or shocking seemed to have occurred. Understanding
this information seeking behavior will allow corrective actions to be taken by
health policymakers to better inform the public for possible future waves of a
pandemic through electronic media, as well as and the social media companies
and search engines to address misinformation among the users in the emergent
markets.","['Mehak Fatima', 'Aimal Rextin', 'Mehwish Nasim', 'Osman Yusuf']",5,0.7911087
"Contrary to expectations that the increased connectivity offered by the
internet and particularly Online Social Networks (OSNs) would result in broad
consensus on contentious issues, we instead frequently observe the formation of
polarised echo chambers, in which only one side of an argument is entertained.
These can progress to filter bubbles, actively filtering contrasting opinions,
resulting in vulnerability to misinformation and increased polarisation on
social and political issues. These have real-world effects when they spread
offline, such as vaccine hesitation and violence. This work seeks to develop a
better understanding of how echo chambers manifest in different discussions
dealing with different issues over an extended period of time. We explore the
activities of two groups of polarised accounts across three Twitter discussions
in the Australian context. We found Australian Twitter accounts arguing against
marriage equality in 2017 were more likely to support the notion that arsonists
were the primary cause of the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires, and those
supporting marriage equality argued against that arson narrative. We also found
strong evidence that the stance people took on marriage equality in 2017 did
not predict their political stance in discussions around the Australian federal
election two years later. Although mostly isolated from each other, we observe
that in certain situations the polarised groups may interact with the broader
community, which offers hope that the echo chambers may be reduced with
concerted outreach to members.","['Mehwish Nasim', 'Derek Weber', 'Tobin South', 'Jonathan Tuke', 'Nigel Bean', 'Lucia Falzon', 'Lewis Mitchell']",10,0.64958465

"Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant
percentage of people are vaccinated. However, vaccine acceptance varies among
communities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors
affecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to
identify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes
and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world.
Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab
people participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify
what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and
behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants,
56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were
hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were
significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas
the analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public
attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media
users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being
exaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media
users. Whereas participants having more trust in vaccine information shared by
their contacts are less likely to agree that decision-makers have verified that
vaccines are safe (OR=0.528, 95% CI= 0.276-1.012, p=0.05). Conclusion: The use
of social media and information shared on it may affect public attitudes
towards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated
information about COVID-19 and other vaccines on social media is important for
increasing public trust and countering the impact of incorrect and
misinformation.","['Md. Rafiul Biswas', 'Hazrat Ali', 'Raian Ali', 'Zubair Shah']",12,0.81955516
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, health-related misinformation and harmful
content shared online had a significant adverse effect on society. To mitigate
this adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms employed soft moderation
interventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts. Despite the
recent popularity of these moderation interventions, we lack empirical analyses
aiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly
during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we analyze
the use of warning labels on TikTok, focusing on COVID-19 videos. First, we
construct a set of 26 COVID-19 related hashtags, then we collect 41K videos
that include those hashtags in their description. Second, we perform a
quantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning
labels on TikTok. Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using
thematic analysis, on 222 COVID-19 related videos to assess the content and the
connection between the content and the warning labels. Our analysis shows that
TikTok broadly applies warning labels on TikTok videos, likely based on
hashtags included in the description. More worrying is the addition of COVID-19
warning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to COVID-19
(23% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to
COVID-19). Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows
that 7.7% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include
warning labels, 37.3% share benign information and include warning labels, and
that 35% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a
warning label) are made for fun. Our study demonstrates the need to develop
more accurate and precise soft moderation systems, especially on a platform
like TikTok that is extremely popular among people of younger age.","['Chen Ling', 'Krishna P. Gummadi', 'Savvas Zannettou']",5,0.58268607

"During Australia's unprecedented bushfires in 2019-2020, misinformation
blaming arson resurfaced on Twitter using #ArsonEmergency. The extent to which
bots were responsible for disseminating and amplifying this misinformation has
received scrutiny in the media and academic research. Here we study Twitter
communities spreading this misinformation during the population-level event,
and investigate the role of online communities and bots. Our in-depth
investigation of the dynamics of the discussion uses a phased approach --
before and after reporting of bots promoting the hashtag was broadcast by the
mainstream media. Though we did not find many bots, the most bot-like accounts
were social bots, which present as genuine humans. Further, we distilled
meaningful quantitative differences between two polarised communities in the
Twitter discussion, resulting in the following insights. First, Supporters of
the arson narrative promoted misinformation by engaging others directly with
replies and mentions using hashtags and links to external sources. In response,
Opposers retweeted fact-based articles and official information. Second,
Supporters were embedded throughout their interaction networks, but Opposers
obtained high centrality more efficiently despite their peripheral positions.
By the last phase, Opposers and unaffiliated accounts appeared to coordinate,
potentially reaching a broader audience. Finally, unaffiliated accounts shared
the same URLs as Opposers over Supporters by a ratio of 9:1 in the last phase,
having shared mostly Supporter URLs in the first phase. This foiled Supporters'
efforts, highlighting the value of exposing misinformation campaigns. We
speculate that the communication strategies observed here could be discoverable
in other misinformation-related discussions and could inform
counter-strategies.","['Derek Weber', 'Lucia Falzon', 'Lewis Mitchell', 'Mehwish Nasim']",10,0.75656784

problem that has impacted different aspects of our lives, including politics

that automates the detection of fake news. Natural human behavior is to
cross-check new information with reliable sources. We use Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and build a machine learning (ML) model that automates the
process of cross-checking new information with a set of predefined reliable
sources. We implement this for Twitter and build a model that flags fake
tweets. Specifically, for a given tweet, we use its text to find relevant news
from reliable news agencies. We then train a Random Forest model that checks if
the textual content of the tweet is aligned with the trusted news. If it is
not, the tweet is classified as fake. This approach can be generally applied to
any kind of information and is not limited to a specific news story or a
category of information. Our implementation of this approach gives a $70\%$
accuracy which outperforms other generic fake-news classification models. These
results pave the way towards a more sensible and natural approach to fake news

"In today's era of digital misinformation, we are increasingly faced with new
threats posed by video falsification techniques. Such falsifications range from
cheapfakes (e.g., lookalikes or audio dubbing) to deepfakes (e.g.,
sophisticated AI media synthesis methods), which are becoming perceptually
indistinguishable from real videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
multi-modal semantic forensic approach to discover clues that go beyond
detecting discrepancies in visual quality, thereby handling both simpler
cheapfakes and visually persuasive deepfakes. In this work, our goal is to
verify that the purported person seen in the video is indeed themselves by
detecting anomalous facial movements corresponding to the spoken words. We
leverage the idea of attribution to learn person-specific biometric patterns
that distinguish a given speaker from others. We use interpretable Action Units
(AUs) to capture a person's face and head movement as opposed to deep CNN
features, and we are the first to use word-conditioned facial motion analysis.

discernment, and directional evidence that explanations increase the warnings'
effectiveness. Interestingly, we do not find that the explanations increase

the amount of misinformation propagated by sentinel nodes. Engagement with
sensationalist misinformation topics is largely confined to a cluster of
sentinel nodes that includes influential conspiracy theorist accounts, while

or misleading news. Concerningly, the COVID-19 pandemic is shaping a
communication network - barely considered in the literature - which reflects
the emergence of collective attention towards a topic that rapidly gained
universal interest. Here, we characterize the dynamics of this network on
Twitter, analyzing how unreliable content distributes among its users. We find
that a minority of accounts is responsible for the majority of the
misinformation circulating online, and identify two categories of users: a few
active ones, playing the role of ""creators"", and a majority playing the role of
""consumers"". The relative proportion of these groups ($\approx$14% creators -
86% consumers) appears stable over time: Consumers are mostly exposed to the
opinions of a vocal minority of creators, that could be mistakenly understood
as of representative of the majority of users. The corresponding pressure from
a perceived majority is identified as a potential driver of the ongoing
COVID-19 infodemic.","['Piergiorgio Castioni', 'Giulia Andrighetto', 'Riccardo Gallotti', 'Eugenia Polizzi', 'Manlio De Domenico']",3,0.6785271
"The effects of social media on critical issues, such as polarization and
misinformation, are under scrutiny due to the disruptive consequences that
these phenomena can have on our societies. Among the algorithms routinely used
by social media platforms, people-recommender systems are of special interest,
as they directly contribute to the evolution of the social network structure,
affecting the information and the opinions users are exposed to.
  In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the effect of people
recommenders on the evolution of opinions. Our proposal is based on Monte Carlo
simulations combining link recommendation and opinion-dynamics models. In order
to control initial conditions, we define a random network model to generate
graphs with opinions, with tunable amounts of modularity and homophily. We join
these elements into a methodology to study the effects of the recommender
system on echo chambers and polarization. We also show how to use our framework
to measure, by means of simulations, the impact of different intervention
strategies.
  Our thorough experimentation shows that people recommenders can in fact lead
to a significant increase in echo chambers. However, this happens only if there
is considerable initial homophily in the network. Also, we find that if the
network already contains echo chambers, the effect of the recommendation
algorithm is negligible. Such findings are robust to two very different opinion
dynamics models, a bounded confidence model and an epistemological model.","['Federico Cinus', 'Marco Minici', 'Corrado Monti', 'Francesco Bonchi']",2,0.7363945
"Misinformation is now a major problem due to its potential high risks to our
core democratic and societal values and orders. Out-of-context misinformation
is one of the easiest and effective ways used by adversaries to spread viral
false stories. In this threat, a real image is re-purposed to support other
narratives by misrepresenting its context and/or elements. The internet is
being used as the go-to way to verify information using different sources and
modalities. Our goal is an inspectable method that automates this
time-consuming and reasoning-intensive process by fact-checking the
image-caption pairing using Web evidence. To integrate evidence and cues from
both modalities, we introduce the concept of 'multi-modal cycle-consistency
check'; starting from the image/caption, we gather textual/visual evidence,
which will be compared against the other paired caption/image, respectively.
Moreover, we propose a novel architecture, Consistency-Checking Network (CCN),
that mimics the layered human reasoning across the same and different
modalities: the caption vs. textual evidence, the image vs. visual evidence,
and the image vs. caption. Our work offers the first step and benchmark for
open-domain, content-based, multi-modal fact-checking, and significantly
outperforms previous baselines that did not leverage external evidence.","['Sahar Abdelnabi', 'Rakibul Hasan', 'Mario Fritz']",7,0.6654073
"Current research in distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking in the partial
information setting assumes that information is exchanged between agents that
are ""truthful"". However, in general noncooperative games agents may consider
sending misinformation to neighboring agents with the goal of further reducing
their cost. Additionally, communication networks are vulnerable to attacks from
agents outside the game as well as communication failures. In this paper, we
propose a distributed NE seeking algorithm that is robust against adversarial
agents that transmit noise, random signals, constant singles, deceitful
messages, as well as being resilient to external factors such as dropped
communication, jammed signals, and man in the middle attacks. The core issue
that makes the problem challenging is that agents have no means of verifying if
the information they receive is correct, i.e. there is no ""ground truth"". To
address this problem, we use an observation graph, that gives truthful action
information, in conjunction with a communication graph, that gives (potentially
incorrect) information. By filtering information obtained from these two
graphs, we show that our algorithm is resilient against adversarial agents and
converges to the Nash equilibrium.","['Dian Gadjov', 'Lacra Pavel']",2,0.6359022
"Fake news and misinformation are a matter of concern for people around the

"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a slew of misinformation, often
described as an ""infodemic"". Whereas previous research has focused on the
propagation of unreliable sources as a main vehicle of misinformation, the
present study focuses on exploring the role of scientists whose views oppose
the scientific consensus. Using Nobelists in Physiology and Medicine as a proxy
for scientific consensus, we analyze two separate datasets: 15.8K tweets by
13.1K unique users on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, and 208K tweets by 151K
unique users on COVID-19 broadly which mention the Nobelist names. Our analyses
reveal that dissenting scientists are amplified by a factor of 426 relative to
true scientific consensus in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, and by a factor
of 43 in the context of COVID-19 generally. Although more popular accounts tend
to mention consensus-abiding scientists more, our results suggest that this
false consensus is driven by higher engagement with dissent-mentioning tweets.
Furthermore, false consensus mostly occurs due to traffic spikes following
highly popularized statements of dissenting scientists. We find that dissenting
voices are mainly discussed in French, English-speaking, Turkish, Brazilian,
Argentine, Indian, and Japanese misinformation clusters. This research suggests
that social media platforms should prioritize the exposure of consensus-abiding

"While Wikipedia has been utilized for fact-checking and claim verification to
debunk misinformation and disinformation, it is essential to either improve
article quality and rule out noisy articles. Self-contradiction is one of the
low-quality article types in Wikipedia. In this work, we propose a task of
detecting self-contradiction articles in Wikipedia. Based on the
""self-contradictory"" template, we create a novel dataset for the
self-contradiction detection task. Conventional contradiction detection focuses
on comparing pairs of sentences or claims, but self-contradiction detection
needs to further reason the semantics of an article and simultaneously learn
the contradiction-aware comparison from all pairs of sentences. Therefore, we
present the first model, Pairwise Contradiction Neural Network (PCNN), to not
only effectively identify self-contradiction articles, but also highlight the
most contradiction pairs of contradiction sentences. The main idea of PCNN is
two-fold. First, to mitigate the effect of data scarcity on self-contradiction
articles, we pre-train the module of pairwise contradiction learning using SNLI
and MNLI benchmarks. Second, we select top-K sentence pairs with the highest
contradiction probability values and model their correlation to determine
whether the corresponding article belongs to self-contradiction. Experiments
conducted on the proposed WikiContradiction dataset exhibit that PCNN can

"Instagram infographics are a digital activism tool that have redefined action

connective action: individualized, low-resource online activism. Yet, we argue
that Instagram infographics are both connective and collective. This paper
juxtaposes the insights of past and present U.S. ethnic movement activists and
analyzes Black Lives Matter Instagram data over the course of 7 years

collective action in three ways: (1) Scope for Education: Visually enticing and
digestible infographics reduce the friction of information dissemination,
facilitating collective movement education while preserving customizability.
(2) Reconciliation for Credibility: Activists use connective features to combat
infographic misinformation and resolve internal differences, creating a trusted

sentiment of their tweets underwent any significant change. Our results
indicate that users overall exhibited statistically significant changes in
behavior across some of these metrics. Through language distance analysis, we

multi-exposure and extreme change groups, which were potentially highly

"Recent years have witnessed an increasing use of coordinated accounts on
social media, operated by misinformation campaigns to influence public opinion
and manipulate social outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to
develop an effective methodology for coordinated group detection to combat the
misinformation on social media. However, existing works suffer from various
drawbacks, such as, either limited performance due to extreme reliance on
predefined signatures of coordination, or instead an inability to address the
natural sparsity of account activities on social media with useful prior domain
knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a coordination detection
framework incorporating neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such
as temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. Specifically, when
modeling the observed data from social media with neural temporal point
process, we jointly learn a Gibbs-like distribution of group assignment based
on how consistent an assignment is to (1) the account embedding space and (2)
the prior knowledge. To address the challenge that the distribution is hard to
be efficiently computed and sampled from, we design a theoretically guaranteed
variational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation for it.
Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our
proposed method compared to the SOTA model in both unsupervised and

clustering, and contextualization. First, the extraction of scientific claims
takes place using a domain-specific, fine-tuned transformer model. Second,
similar claims extracted from heterogeneous sources are clustered together with

"Misinformation posting and spreading in Social Media is ignited by personal
decisions on the truthfulness of news that may cause wide and deep cascades at
a large scale in a fraction of minutes. When individuals are exposed to
information, they usually take a few seconds to decide if the content (or the
source) is reliable, and eventually to share it. Although the opportunity to
verify the rumour is often just one click away, many users fail to make a
correct evaluation. We studied this phenomenon with a web-based questionnaire
that was compiled by 7,298 different volunteers, where the participants were
asked to mark 20 news as true or false. Interestingly, false news is correctly
identified more frequently than true news, but showing the full article instead
of just the title, surprisingly, does not increase general accuracy. Also,
displaying the original source of the news may contribute to mislead the user
in some cases, while a genuine wisdom of the crowd can positively assist
individuals' ability to classify correctly. Finally, participants whose
browsing activity suggests a parallel fact-checking activity, show better
performance and declare themselves as young adults. This work highlights a

"Socialbots are software-driven user accounts on social platforms, acting
autonomously (mimicking human behavior), with the aims to influence the
opinions of other users or spread targeted misinformation for particular goals.
As socialbots undermine the ecosystem of social platforms, they are often
considered harmful. As such, there have been several computational efforts to
auto-detect the socialbots. However, to our best knowledge, the adversarial
nature of these socialbots has not yet been studied. This begs a question ""can
adversaries, controlling socialbots, exploit AI techniques to their advantage?""
To this question, we successfully demonstrate that indeed it is possible for
adversaries to exploit computational learning mechanism such as reinforcement
learning (RL) to maximize the influence of socialbots while avoiding being
detected. We first formulate the adversarial socialbot learning as a
cooperative game between two functional hierarchical RL agents. While one agent
curates a sequence of activities that can avoid the detection, the other agent
aims to maximize network influence by selectively connecting with right users.
Our proposed policy networks train with a vast amount of synthetic graphs and
generalize better than baselines on unseen real-life graphs both in terms of
maximizing network influence (up to +18%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to
+40% undetectability) under a strong bot detector (with 90% detection
accuracy). During inference, the complexity of our approach scales linearly,
independent of a network's structure and the virality of news. This makes our
approach a practical adversarial attack when deployed in a real-life setting.","['Thai Le', 'Long Tran-Thanh', 'Dongwon Lee']",13,0.793404
"From the 2016 U.S. presidential election to the 2021 Capitol riots to the
spread of misinformation related to COVID-19, many have blamed social media for
today's deeply divided society. Recent advances in machine learning for signed
networks hold the promise to guide small interventions with the goal of
reducing polarization in social media. However, existing models are especially
ineffective in predicting conflicts (or negative links) among users. This is
due to a strong correlation between link signs and the network structure, where
negative links between polarized communities are too sparse to be predicted
even by state-of-the-art approaches. To address this problem, we first design a
partition-agnostic polarization measure for signed graphs based on the signed

"Fact-checking is an essential tool to mitigate the spread of misinformation

is a relatively unexplored area. We construct DialFact, a testing benchmark
dataset of 22,245 annotated conversational claims, paired with pieces of
evidence from Wikipedia. There are three sub-tasks in DialFact: 1) Verifiable
claim detection task distinguishes whether a response carries verifiable
factual information; 2) Evidence retrieval task retrieves the most relevant
Wikipedia snippets as evidence; 3) Claim verification task predicts a dialogue
response to be supported, refuted, or not enough information. We found that
existing fact-checking models trained on non-dialogue data like FEVER fail to
perform well on our task, and thus, we propose a simple yet data-efficient
solution to effectively improve fact-checking performance in dialogue. We point
out unique challenges in DialFact such as handling the colloquialisms,
coreferences and retrieval ambiguities in the error analysis to shed light on

"With a rise in false, inaccurate, and misleading information in propaganda,
news, and social media, real-world Question Answering (QA) systems face the
challenges of synthesizing and reasoning over misinformation-polluted contexts
to derive correct answers. This urgency gives rise to the need to make QA
systems robust to misinformation, a topic previously unexplored. We study the
risk of misinformation to QA models by investigating the sensitivity of
open-domain QA models to corpus pollution with misinformation documents. We
curate both human-written and model-generated false documents that we inject
into the evidence corpus of QA models and assess the impact on the performance
of these systems. Experiments show that QA models are vulnerable to even small
amounts of evidence contamination brought by misinformation, with large
absolute performance drops on all models. Misinformation attack brings more
threat when fake documents are produced at scale by neural models or the
attacker targets hacking specific questions of interest. To defend against such
a threat, we discuss the necessity of building a misinformation-aware QA system
that integrates question-answering and misinformation detection in a joint
fashion.","['Liangming Pan', 'Wenhu Chen', 'Min-Yen Kan', 'William Yang Wang']",1,0.74065775
"Since late 2019, COVID-19 has quickly emerged as the newest biomedical
domain, resulting in a surge of new information. As with other emergent
domains, the discussion surrounding the topic has been rapidly changing,
leading to the spread of misinformation. This has created the need for a public
space for users to ask questions and receive credible, scientific answers. To
fulfill this need, we turn to the task of open-domain question-answering, which
we can use to efficiently find answers to free-text questions from a large set
of documents. In this work, we present such a system for the emergent domain of
COVID-19. Despite the small data size available, we are able to successfully
train the system to retrieve answers from a large-scale corpus of published
COVID-19 scientific papers. Furthermore, we incorporate effective re-ranking
and question-answering techniques, such as document diversity and multiple
answer spans. Our open-domain question-answering system can further act as a

"Vaccine hesitancy and other COVID-19-related concerns and complaints in the
Philippines are evident on social media. It is important to identify these
different topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the
insights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to
improve public image and reputation of the administering agency and the
COVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine
learning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an
analysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of
national public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of
a multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five
different classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT
topic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that
any type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public
opinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an
unsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal
that 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics.
Such negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the
Philippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries.
Additionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Facebook posts by the

generalise poorly to attack types that are unknown at training time. To tackle
this problem, we introduce a differential anomaly detection framework in which
deep face embeddings are first extracted from pairs of images (i.e., reference

"Recent research suggests that not all fact-checking efforts are equal: when
and what is fact-checked plays a pivotal role in effectively correcting
misconceptions. In that context, signals capturing how much attention specific
topics receive on the Internet have the potential to study (and possibly
support) fact-checking efforts. This paper proposes a framework to study
fact-checking with online attention signals. The framework consists of: 1)
extracting claims from fact-checking efforts; 2) linking such claims with
knowledge graph entities; and 3) estimating the online attention these entities
receive. We use this framework to conduct a preliminary study of a dataset of
879 COVID-19-related fact-checks done in 2020 by 81 international
organizations. Our findings suggest that there is often a disconnect between
online attention and fact-checking efforts. For example, in around 40% of
countries that fact-checked ten or more claims, half or more than half of the
ten most popular claims were not fact-checked. Our analysis also shows that
claims are first fact-checked after receiving, on average, 35% of the total
online attention they would eventually receive in 2020. Yet, there is a
considerable variation among claims: some were fact-checked before receiving a
surge of misinformation-induced online attention; others are fact-checked much
later. Overall, our work suggests that the incorporation of online attention
signals may help organizations assess their fact-checking efforts and choose
what and when to fact-check claims or stories. Also, in the context of
international collaboration, where claims are fact-checked multiple times
across different countries, online attention could help organizations keep

"Recent years have seen a strong uptick in both the prevalence and real-world
consequences of false information spread through online platforms. At the same
time, encrypted messaging systems such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, are
rapidly gaining popularity as users seek increased privacy in their digital
lives.
  The challenge we address is how to combat the viral spread of misinformation
without compromising privacy. Our FACTS system tracks user complaints on
messages obliviously, only revealing the message's contents and originator once
sufficiently many complaints have been lodged.
  Our system is private, meaning it does not reveal anything about the senders
or contents of messages which have received few or no complaints; secure,
meaning there is no way for a malicious user to evade the system or gain an
outsized impact over the complaint system; and scalable, as we demonstrate
excellent practical efficiency for up to millions of complaints per day.
  Our main technical contribution is a new collaborative counting Bloom filter,
a simple construction with difficult probabilistic analysis, which may have
independent interest as a privacy-preserving randomized count sketch data
structure.
  Compared to prior work on message flagging and tracing in end-to-end
encrypted messaging, our novel contribution is the addition of a high threshold
of multiple complaints that are needed before a message is audited or flagged.
  We present and carefully analyze the probabilistic performance of our data
structure, provide a precise security definition and proof, and then measure
the accuracy and scalability of our scheme via experimentation.","['Linsheng Liu', 'Daniel S. Roche', 'Austin Theriault', 'Arkady Yerukhimovich']",4,0.60472786
"The role of social media in opinion formation has far-reaching implications
in all spheres of society. Though social media provide platforms for expressing
news and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer
volumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and
rumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's
opinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very
important to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to
prevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification
of social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as
it is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous
studies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter.
These approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context
features from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours.
Manually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume
of tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising
sentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the
usual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to
represent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual
meaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by
using various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved
the accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.","['Rini Anggrainingsih', 'Ghulam Mubashar Hassan', 'Amitava Datta']",10,0.68716586
"Twitter bot detection has become an important and challenging task to combat
misinformation and protect the integrity of the online discourse.
State-of-the-art approaches generally leverage the topological structure of the
Twittersphere, while they neglect the heterogeneity of relations and influence
among users. In this paper, we propose a novel bot detection framework to
alleviate this problem, which leverages the topological structure of
user-formed heterogeneous graphs and models varying influence intensity between
users. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous information network with
users as nodes and diversified relations as edges. We then propose relational
graph transformers to model heterogeneous influence between users and learn
node representations. Finally, we use semantic attention networks to aggregate
messages across users and relations and conduct heterogeneity-aware Twitter bot
detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive Twitter bot detection benchmark.
Additional studies also bear out the effectiveness of our proposed relational
graph transformers, semantic attention networks and the graph-based approach in
general.","['Shangbin Feng', 'Zhaoxuan Tan', 'Rui Li', 'Minnan Luo']",2,0.7219615

"Most Fairness in AI research focuses on exposing biases in AI systems. A
broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration:
rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on
inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using
AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many
of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the
quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias
detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and
health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient
outcomes and wellbeing.
  In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose
a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical
education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation,
which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage
researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate
biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts
minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several

"A great deal of empirical research has examined who falls for misinformation
and why. Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with
news stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information
consumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns
of engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is
because producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that
lead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true
ones -- even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information.
We then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In
three studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they
perceive as more accurate -- both in a general population sample, and in a
sample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to
misinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news -- and
consistent with the predictions of our model -- we find markedly different
engagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news
sites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news
sites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings
collected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively
correlated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively
correlated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites. Taken together, these
theoretical and empirical results suggest that consumer preferences cannot be
straightforwardly inferred from empirical patterns of engagement.","['Alexander J. Stewart', 'Antonio A. Arechar', 'David G. Rand', 'Joshua B. Plotkin']",4,0.7350405
"Research in media forensics has gained traction to combat the spread of

content generated on social media. Biomedical image forensics is a related
problem, where manipulation or misuse of images reported in biomedical research

an academic discussion due to an absence of benchmark datasets and standardized

internal duplication detection and cut/sharp-transition detection. We benchmark
BioFors on all tasks with suitable state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results and

"Historians and researchers trust web archives to preserve social media
content that no longer exists on the live web. However, what we see on the live

paper, we document and analyze the problems in archiving Twitter ever since
Twitter forced the use of its new UI in June 2020. Most web archives were
unable to archive the new UI, resulting in archived Twitter pages displaying
Twitter's ""Something went wrong"" error. The challenges in archiving the new UI
forced web archives to continue using the old UI. To analyze the potential loss
of information in web archival data due to this change, we used the personal
Twitter account of the 45th President of the United States, @realDonaldTrump,
which was suspended by Twitter on January 8, 2021. Trump's account was heavily
labeled by Twitter for spreading misinformation, however we discovered that
there is no evidence in web archives to prove that some of his tweets ever had
a label assigned to them. We also studied the possibility of temporal
violations in archived versions of the new UI, which may result in the replay
of pages that never existed on the live web. Our goal is to educate researchers

"The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the amount of mis- and
disinformation online, from targeted disinformation campaigns to influence
politics, to the unintentional spreading of misinformation about public health.
This development has spurred research in the area of automatic fact checking,
from approaches to detect check-worthy claims and determining the stance of
tweets towards claims, to methods to determine the veracity of claims given
evidence documents. These automatic methods are often content-based, using
natural language processing methods, which in turn utilise deep neural networks
to learn higher-order features from text in order to make predictions. As deep
neural networks are black-box models, their inner workings cannot be easily
explained. At the same time, it is desirable to explain how they arrive at
certain decisions, especially if they are to be used for decision making. While
this has been known for some time, the issues this raises have been exacerbated
by models increasing in size, and by EU legislation requiring models to be used
for decision making to provide explanations, and, very recently, by legislation
requiring online platforms operating in the EU to provide transparent reporting
on their services. Despite this, current solutions for explainability are still

"As news organizations embrace transparency practices on their websites to

scenario to demonstrate transparency features using two fundamental news
attributes that convey the trustworthiness of a news article: source and
message. In the interviews, our news consumers expressed the idea that news
transparency could be best shown by providing indicators of objectivity in two
areas (news selection and framing) and by providing indicators of evidence in
four areas (presence of source materials, anonymous sourcing, verification, and
corrections upon erroneous reporting). While our journalists agreed with news
consumers' suggestions of using evidence indicators, they also suggested
additional transparency indicators in areas such as the news reporting process
and personal/organizational conflicts of interest. Prompted by our scenario,
participants offered new design considerations for building trustworthy news
platforms, such as designing for easy comprehension, presenting appropriate
details in news articles (e.g., showing the number and nature of corrections
made to an article), and comparing attributes across news organizations to
highlight diverging practices. Comparing the responses from our two stakeholder

"Enormous hope in the efficacy of vaccines became recently a successful

"Struggling to curb misinformation, social media platforms are experimenting
with design interventions to enhance consumption of credible news on their
platforms. Some of these interventions, such as the use of warning messages,
are examples of nudges -- a choice-preserving technique to steer behavior.
Despite their application, we do not know whether nudges could steer people
into making conscious news credibility judgments online and if they do, under
what constraints. To answer, we combine nudge techniques with heuristic based
information processing to design NudgeCred -- a browser extension for Twitter.
NudgeCred directs users' attention to two design cues: authority of a source
and other users' collective opinion on a report by activating three design
nudges -- Reliable, Questionable, and Unreliable, each denoting particular
levels of credibility for news tweets. In a controlled experiment, we found
that NudgeCred significantly helped users (n=430) distinguish news tweets'
credibility, unrestricted by three behavioral confounds -- political ideology,
political cynicism, and media skepticism. A five-day field deployment with
twelve participants revealed that NudgeCred improved their recognition of news

"Recent work has demonstrated the viability of using crowdsourcing as a tool
for evaluating the truthfulness of public statements. Under certain conditions
such as: (1) having a balanced set of workers with different backgrounds and
cognitive abilities; (2) using an adequate set of mechanisms to control the
quality of the collected data; and (3) using a coarse grained assessment scale,
the crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news
are a subtle matter: statements can be just biased (""cherrypicked""), imprecise,
wrong, etc. and the unidimensional truth scale used in existing work cannot
account for such differences. In this paper we propose a multidimensional
notion of truthfulness and we ask the crowd workers to assess seven different
dimensions of truthfulness selected based on existing literature: Correctness,

Trustworthiness, and Informativeness. We deploy a set of quality control
mechanisms to ensure that the thousands of assessments collected on 180
publicly available fact-checked statements distributed over two datasets are of
adequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to
find web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive

reached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between

the CoronaVirusFacts Alliance, which contains 10,381 debunks related to
COVID-19 published in multiple languages by different fact-checking
organisations. Our spatiotemporal analysis reveals that similar or nearly
duplicate false COVID-19 narratives have been spreading in multiple modalities
and on various social media platforms in different countries, sometimes as much
as several months after the first debunk of that narrative has been published
by an International Fact-checking Network (IFCN) fact-checker. We also find
that misinformation involving general medical advice has spread across multiple
countries and hence has the highest proportion of false COVID-19 narratives
that keep being debunked. Furthermore, as manual fact-checking is an onerous
task in itself, therefore the need to repeatedly debunk the same narrative in
different countries is leading, over time, to a significant waste of
fact-checker resources. To this end, we propose the idea of including a
multilingual debunk search tool in the fact-checking pipeline, in addition to
recommending strongly that social media platforms need to adopt the same
technology at scale, so as to make the best use of scarce fact-checker
resources.","['Iknoor Singh', 'Kalina Bontcheva', 'Carolina Scarton']",5,0.7056223
"Recently, the misinformation problem has been addressed with a
crowdsourcing-based approach: to assess the truthfulness of a statement,
instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of non-expert is exploited. We
study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess
truthfulness during a pandemic, targeting statements related to COVID-19, thus
addressing (mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal
issue and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done. In our
experiments, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements,
and to provide evidence for the assessments. Besides showing that the crowd is
able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we report results
on workers behavior, agreement among workers, effect of aggregation functions,
of scales transformations, and of workers background and bias. We perform a
longitudinal study by re-launching the task multiple times with both novice and
experienced workers, deriving important insights on how the behavior and
quality change over time. Our results show that: workers are able to detect and
objectively categorize online (mis)information related to COVID-19; both
crowdsourced and expert judgments can be transformed and aggregated to improve
quality; worker background and other signals (e.g., source of information,
behavior) impact the quality of the data. The longitudinal study demonstrates
that the time-span has a major effect on the quality of the judgments, for both
novice and experienced workers. Finally, we provide an extensive failure
analysis of the statements misjudged by the crowd-workers.","['Kevin Roitero', 'Michael Soprano', 'Beatrice Portelli', 'Massimiliano De Luise', 'Damiano Spina', 'Vincenzo Della Mea', 'Giuseppe Serra', 'Stefano Mizzaro', 'Gianluca Demartini']",0,0.67073464
"Online discussion platforms offer a forum to strengthen and propagate belief
in misinformed conspiracy theories. Yet, they also offer avenues for conspiracy
theorists to express their doubts and experiences of cognitive dissonance. Such
expressions of dissonance may shed light on who abandons misguided beliefs and
under which circumstances. This paper characterizes self-disclosures of
dissonance about QAnon, a conspiracy theory initiated by a mysterious leader Q
and popularized by their followers, anons in conspiracy theory subreddits. To
understand what dissonance and disbelief mean within conspiracy communities, we
first characterize their social imaginaries, a broad understanding of how
people collectively imagine their social existence. Focusing on 2K posts from
two image boards, 4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12
subreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed methods approach to uncover the
symbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices, heroes
and foes of the QAnon community. We use these social imaginaries to create a
computational framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general
discussion about QAnon. Further, analyzing user engagement with QAnon
conspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of dissonance correlate
with a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their
departure from the community. We contribute a computational framework for
identifying dissonance self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user
engagement surrounding dissonance. Our work can provide insights into designing
dissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade conspiracists from
online conspiracy discussion communities.","['Shruti Phadke', 'Mattia Samory', 'Tanushree Mitra']",3,0.6173854
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media platforms were ideal for
communicating due to social isolation and quarantine. Also, it was the primary
source of misinformation dissemination on a large scale, referred to as the
infodemic. Therefore, automatic debunking misinformation is a crucial problem.
To tackle this problem, we present two COVID-19 related misinformation datasets
on Twitter and propose a misinformation detection system comprising
network-based and content-based processes based on machine learning algorithms
and NLP techniques. In the network-based process, we focus on social
properties, network characteristics, and users. On the other hand, we classify
misinformation using the content of the tweets directly in the content-based
process, which contains text classification models (paragraph-level and
sentence-level) and similarity models. The evaluation results on the
network-based process show the best results for the artificial neural network
model with an F1 score of 88.68%. In the content-based process, our novel
similarity models, which obtained an F1 score of 90.26%, show an improvement in
the misinformation classification results compared to the network-based models.
In addition, in the text classification models, the best result was achieved
using the stacking ensemble-learning model by obtaining an F1 score of 95.18%.
Furthermore, we test our content-based models on the Constraint@AAAI2021
dataset, and by getting an F1 score of 94.38%, we improve the baseline results.
Finally, we develop a fact-checking website called Checkovid that uses each
process to detect misinformative and informative claims in the domain of
COVID-19 from different perspectives.","['Sajad Dadgar', 'Mehdi Ghatee']",1,0.6613366

is designed to induce a specific, targeted translation behaviour, such as

"The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic has largely amplified the spread of
related information on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, and
WeChat.Unlike the previous studies which focused on how to detect the
misinformation or fake news related toCOVID-19, we investigate how the disease
and information co-evolve in the population. We focus onCOVID-19and its
information during the period when the disease was widely spread in China,
i.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We first explore how the disease
and information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading
processes. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the
province level and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to
information. We find a high correlation between the disease and information
data, and also people care about the spread only when it comes to their
neighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive
messages are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative
and neutral messages. Additionally, we introduce machine learning algorithms,
i.e., linear regression and random forest, to further predict the number of
infected using different disease spatial related and information-related
characteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of
nearby cities can help to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile,
information-related characteristics can also help to improve the prediction
performance, but with a delay, i.e., the improvement comes from using, for
instance, the number of messages 10 days ago, for disease prediction. The

"Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs through a population
has never seemed so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page
from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how
a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those
disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's set of current
beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the
interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially
important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science
modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated
cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in
empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model
that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal
cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a
public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which
begin opinion cascades. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model
with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and
institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that
population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has
been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model
dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs.
The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation
researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to
understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of
disinformation and ""alternative facts.""","['Nicholas Rabb', 'Lenore Cowen', 'Jan P. de Ruiter', 'Matthias Scheutz']",2,0.6779691

differentiate using this information. Using caption dataset, the proposed

"We introduce a FEVER-like dataset COVID-Fact of $4,086$ claims concerning the
COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset contains claims, evidence for the claims, and
contradictory claims refuted by the evidence. Unlike previous approaches, we
automatically detect true claims and their source articles and then generate
counter-claims using automatic methods rather than employing human annotators.
Along with our constructed resource, we formally present the task of
identifying relevant evidence for the claims and verifying whether the evidence
refutes or supports a given claim. In addition to scientific claims, our data
contains simplified general claims from media sources, making it better suited
for detecting general misinformation regarding COVID-19. Our experiments

"The rise in online misinformation in recent years threatens democracies by
distorting authentic public discourse and causing confusion, fear, and even, in
extreme cases, violence. There is a need to understand the spread of false

Transformer for Language Understanding (BERT) and propagation graphs, this
study classifies and visualizes the spread of misinformation on a social media

"In this position paper we approach problems concerning critical digital and
information literacy with ideas to provide more digestible explanations of
abstract concepts through interface design. In particular, we focus on social
media platforms where we see the possibility of counteracting the spread of
misinformation by providing users with more proficiency through our approaches.
We argue that the omnipresent trend to abstract away and hide information from
users via UI/UX design opposes their ability to self-learn. This leads us to
propose a different framework in which we unify elegant and simple interfaces
with nudges that promote a look behind the curtain. Such designs serve to
foster a deeper understanding of employed technologies and aim to increase the
critical assessment of content encountered on social platforms. Furthermore, we
consider users with an intermediary skill level to be largely ignored in
current approaches, as they are given no tools to broaden their knowledge
without consultation of expert material. The resulting stagnation is
exemplified by the tactics of misinformation campaigns, which exploit the
ensuing lack of information literacy and critical thinking. We propose an
approach to design that sufficiently emancipates users in both aspects by
promoting a look behind the abstraction of UI/UX so that an autonomous learning
process is given the chance to occur. Furthermore, we name ideas for future
research within this area that take our considerations into account.",['Jan Wolff'],0,0.7135243
"Language generation models' democratization benefits many domains, from
answering health-related questions to enhancing education by providing
AI-driven tutoring services. However, language generation models'
democratization also makes it easier to generate human-like text at-scale for
nefarious activities, from spreading misinformation to targeting specific
groups with hate speech. Thus, it is essential to understand how people
interact with bots and develop methods to detect bot-generated text. This paper
shows that bot-generated text detection methods are more robust across datasets
and models if we use information about how people respond to it rather than
using the bot's text directly. We also analyze linguistic alignment, providing
insight into differences between human-human and human-bot conversations.","['Paras Bhatt', 'Anthony Rios']",13,0.7552792

two seemingly orthogonal perspectives: UX design perspective and data science.

social media feeds; Data science researchers analyze the misinformation flow in
these feeds to detect alternative narratives and state-sponsored disinformation
campaigns. We took a critical look into the intersection of these approaches to
understand how Parler's interface itself is conductive to the flow of
misinformation and the perception of ""free speech"" among its audience. Parler
drew widespread attention leading up to and after the 2020 U.S. elections as
the ""alternative"" place for free speech, as a reaction to other mainstream

"The rapid advances in deep generative models over the past years have led to
highly {realistic media, known as deepfakes,} that are commonly
indistinguishable from real to human eyes. These advances make assessing the
authenticity of visual data increasingly difficult and pose a misinformation
threat to the trustworthiness of visual content in general. Although recent
work has shown strong detection accuracy of such deepfakes, the success largely
relies on identifying frequency artifacts in the generated images, which will
not yield a sustainable detection approach as generative models continue
evolving and closing the gap to real images. In order to overcome this issue,
we propose a novel fake detection that is designed to re-synthesize testing
images and extract visual cues for detection. The re-synthesis procedure is
flexible, allowing us to incorporate a series of visual tasks - we adopt
super-resolution, denoising and colorization as the re-synthesis. We

increasingly problematic, making necessary the development of appropriate
countermeasures. In this work, we perform hate speech detection on a corpus of
more than one million comments on YouTube videos through a machine learning

there is no evidence of the presence of ""serial haters"", intended as active
users posting exclusively hateful comments. Moreover, coherently with the echo

of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate,
violent, or hateful language within their opponents community. Interestingly,
users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their

"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently achieved unprecedented
success in photo-realistic image synthesis from low-dimensional random noise.
The ability to synthesize high-quality content at a large scale brings
potential risks as the generated samples may lead to misinformation that can
create severe social, political, health, and business hazards. We propose
SubsetGAN to identify generated content by detecting a subset of anomalous
node-activations in the inner layers of pre-trained neural networks. These
nodes, as a group, maximize a non-parametric measure of divergence away from
the expected distribution of activations created from real data. This enable us
to identify synthesised images without prior knowledge of their distribution.
SubsetGAN efficiently scores subsets of nodes and returns the group of nodes
within the pre-trained classifier that contributed to the maximum score. The
classifier can be a general fake classifier trained over samples from multiple
sources or the discriminator network from different GANs. Our approach shows
consistently higher detection power than existing detection methods across

"Social Networks' omnipresence and ease of use has revolutionized the

the public, and ultimately can seriously endanger the democratic processes.
Limiting false information's negative impact through early detection and

today. In this survey paper, we extensively analyze a wide range of different
solutions for the early detection of fake news in the existing literature. More

problem that causes disputes and endangers societal stability and harmony. Fake
news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature.
proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news,

propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of
the news at the early stage i.e. when the news is published but is yet to be
disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with
automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary,
we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the

"YouTube has revolutionized the way people discover and consume video.
Although YouTube facilitates easy access to hundreds of well-produced and
trustworthy videos, abhorrent, misinformative, and mistargeted content is also
common. The platform is plagued by various types of problematic content: 1)
disturbing videos targeting young children; 2) hateful and misogynistic
content; and 3) pseudoscientific misinformation. While YouTube's recommendation
algorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's
monetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not
entirely understood. In this thesis, we shed some light on the degree of
problematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in
the dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative
approach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the
risks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the
recommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by
focusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure
to pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this
exposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that
young children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly
browse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that
Incel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active
role in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying
pseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more
pseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g.,
flat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these

"The proliferation of fake news, i.e., news intentionally spread for

required to deal with the increase in fake news. Several deep learning models

capture lexical and semantic properties of both true and fake news text.

PolitiFact and GossipCop, and demonstrate that the TM framework significantly
outperforms previously published baselines by at least $5\%$ in terms of
accuracy, with the added benefit of an interpretable logic-based

"In 2020, amidst the COVID pandemic and a polarized political climate, the
Sleeping Giants online activist movement gained traction in Brazil. Its
rationale was simple: to curb the spread of misinformation by harming the
advertising revenue of sources that produce this type of content. Like its
international counterparts, Sleeping Giants Brasil (SGB) campaigned against
media outlets using Twitter to ask companies to remove ads from the targeted
outlets. This work presents a thorough quantitative characterization of this
activism model, analyzing the three campaigns carried out by SGB between May
and September 2020. To do so, we use digital traces from both Twitter and
Google Trends, toxicity and sentiment classifiers trained for the Portuguese
language, and an annotated corpus of SGB's tweets. Our key findings were
threefold. First, we found that SGB's requests to companies were largely
successful (with 83.85\% of all 192 targeted companies responding positively)
and that user pressure was correlated to the speed of companies' responses.
Second, there were no significant changes in the online attention and the user
engagement going towards the targeted media outlets in the six months that
followed SGB's campaign (as measured by Google Trends and Twitter engagement).
Third, we observed that user interactions with companies changed only
transiently, even if the companies did not respond to SGB's request. Overall,
our results paint a nuanced portrait of internet activism. On the one hand,
they suggest that SGB was successful in getting companies to boycott specific
media outlets, which may have harmed their advertisement revenue stream. On the
other hand, they also suggest that the activist movement did not impact the

"Social media contains unfiltered and unique information, which is potentially
of great value, but, in the case of misinformation, can also do great harm.
With regards to biomedical topics, false information can be particularly
dangerous. Methods of automatic fact-checking and fake news detection address
this problem, but have not been applied to the biomedical domain in social
media yet. We aim to fill this research gap and annotate a corpus of 1200
tweets for implicit and explicit biomedical claims (the latter also with span
annotations for the claim phrase). With this corpus, which we sample to be
related to COVID-19, measles, cystic fibrosis, and depression, we develop
baseline models which detect tweets that contain a claim automatically. Our
analyses reveal that biomedical tweets are densely populated with claims (45 %
in a corpus sampled to contain 1200 tweets focused on the domains mentioned
above). Baseline classification experiments with embedding-based classifiers
and BERT-based transfer learning demonstrate that the detection is challenging,

"The COVID-19 pandemic has been damaging to the lives of people all around the
world. Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and
uncontrolled spreading of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may
severely change the pandemic's course by interfering with public health
interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In
particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it
holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents
findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the
COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations' susceptibility to false
claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on
responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a
strong association between perceived believability of misinformation and
vaccination hesitancy. Additionally, our study shows that only half of the
online users exposed to rumors might have seen the fact-checked information.
Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals
considered these rumors believable. Our survey also shows that poorer regions
are more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation. We
discuss implications of our findings on public campaigns that proactively
spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the
infodemic. We also highlight fact-checking platforms' role in better
identifying and prioritizing claims that are perceived to be believable and
have wide exposure. Our findings give insights into better handling of risk

"Widespread uptake of vaccines is necessary to achieve herd immunity. However,
uptake rates have varied across U.S. states during the first six months of the
COVID-19 vaccination program. Misbeliefs may play an important role in vaccine
hesitancy, and there is a need to understand relationships between
misinformation, beliefs, behaviors, and health outcomes. Here we investigate
the extent to which COVID-19 vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy are
associated with levels of online misinformation about vaccines. We also look
for evidence of directionality from online misinformation to vaccine hesitancy.
We find a negative relationship between misinformation and vaccination uptake
rates. Online misinformation is also correlated with vaccine hesitancy rates
taken from survey data. Associations between vaccine outcomes and
misinformation remain significant when accounting for political as well as
demographic and socioeconomic factors. While vaccine hesitancy is strongly
associated with Republican vote share, we observe that the effect of online
misinformation on hesitancy is strongest across Democratic rather than
Republican counties. Granger causality analysis shows evidence for a
directional relationship from online misinformation to vaccine hesitancy. Our
results support a need for interventions that address misbeliefs, allowing

"Misinformation undermines the credibility of social media and poses
significant threats to modern societies. As a countermeasure, Twitter has
recently introduced ""Birdwatch,"" a community-driven approach to address
misinformation on Twitter. On Birdwatch, users can identify tweets they believe
are misleading, write notes that provide context to the tweet and rate the
quality of other users' notes. In this work, we empirically analyze how users
interact with this new feature. For this purpose, we collect {all} Birdwatch
notes and ratings between the introduction of the feature in early 2021 and end
of July 2021. We then map each Birdwatch note to the fact-checked tweet using
Twitter's historical API. In addition, we use text mining methods to extract
content characteristics from the text explanations in the Birdwatch notes
(e.g., sentiment). Our empirical analysis yields the following main findings:
(i) users more frequently file Birdwatch notes for misleading than not
misleading tweets. These misleading tweets are primarily reported because of
factual errors, lack of important context, or because they treat unverified
claims as facts. (ii) Birdwatch notes are more helpful to other users if they
link to trustworthy sources and if they embed a more positive sentiment. (iii)
The social influence of the author of the source tweet is associated with
differences in the level of user consensus. For influential users with many
followers, Birdwatch notes yield a lower level of consensus among users and
community-created fact checks are more likely to be seen as being incorrect and
argumentative. Altogether, our findings can help social media platforms to
formulate guidelines for users on how to write more helpful fact checks. At the
same time, our analysis suggests that community-based fact-checking faces
challenges regarding opinion speculation and polarization among the user base.",['Nicolas Pröllochs'],3,0.66719806

"Fake tweets are observed to be ever-increasing, demanding immediate

which may not be an ideal setting for cases like COVID-19 where both aspects
are largely absent. In this work, we present ENDEMIC, a novel early detection

"Future societal systems will be characterized by heterogeneous human

pathways that connect the different systems and several invariant behaviors and
patterns that have emerged globally. On the contrary, infodemics of
misinformation can be a risk as it has occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic. The
emerging fragility or robustness of the system will depend on how this complex
network of systems is governed. Future societal systems will not be only
multiscale in terms of the social dimension, but also in the temporality.
Necessary and proper prevention and response systems based on complexity, ethic
and multi-scale governance will be required. Real-time response systems are the
basis for resilience to be the foundation of robust societies. A top-down
approach led by Governmental organs for managing humandemics is not sufficient

election alternatives out of which one is assumed to be correct. In ODP, the
goal is to organise the delegations in the social network in order to maximize
the probability that the correct alternative, referred to as ground truth, is
elected. While the problem is known to be computationally hard, we strengthen
existing hardness results by providing a novel strong approximation hardness
result: For any positive constant $C$, we prove that, unless $P=NP$, there is
no polynomial-time algorithm for ODP that achieves an approximation guarantee
of $\alpha \ge (\ln n)^{-C}$, where $n$ is the number of voters. The reduction
designed for this result uses poorly connected social networks in which some
voters suffer from misinformation. Interestingly, under some hypothesis on
either the accuracies of voters or the connectivity of the network, we obtain a
polynomial-time $1/2$-approximation algorithm. This observation proves formally
that the connectivity of the social network is a key feature for the efficiency
of the liquid democracy paradigm. Lastly, we run extensive simulations and

classifying content, we propose an evidence retrieval approach to handle fake
news. The learning task is formulated as an unsupervised machine learning
problem. For validation purpose, we provide the user with a set of news
articles from reliable news sources supporting the hypothesis of the news
article in query and the final decision is left to the user. Technically we
propose a two-step process: (i) Aggregation-step: With information extracted
from the given text we query for similar content from reliable news sources.
(ii) Refining-step: We narrow the supporting evidence down by measuring the
semantic distance of the text with the collection from step (i). The distance
is calculated based on Word2Vec and the Word Mover's Distance. In our
experiments, only content that is below a certain distance threshold is
considered as supporting evidence. We find that our approach is agnostic to
concept drifts, i.e. the machine learning task is independent of the hypotheses

the other epidemiological models, this model produces broader results because
it includes the additional Skeptics (Z) compartment, wherein a user may be
exposed to an item of misinformation but not engage in any reaction to it, and
the additional Exposed (E) compartment, wherein the user may need some time
before deciding to spread a misinformation item. We analyzed misinformation
regarding the unrest in Washington, D.C. in the month of March 2020 which was
propagated by the use of the #DCblackout hashtag by different users across the
U.S. on Twitter. Our analysis shows that misinformation can be modeled using
the concept of epidemiology. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the
first to attempt to apply the SEIZ epidemiological model to the spread of a
specific item of misinformation, which is a category distinct from that of
rumor, and a hoax on online social media platforms. Applying a mathematical
model can help to understand the trends and dynamics of the spread of
misinformation on Twitter and ultimately help to develop techniques to quickly
identify and control it.","['Maryam Maleki', 'Esther Mead', 'Mohammad Arani', 'Nitin Agarwal']",5,0.69913936
"Over the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of misinformation on the
Internet, with online users constantly falling victims of fake news. A
multitude of past studies have analyzed fake news diffusion mechanics and
detection and mitigation techniques. However, there are still open questions
about their operational behavior such as: How old are fake news websites? Do
they typically stay online for long periods of time? Do such websites
synchronize with each other their up and down time? Do they share similar
content through time? Which third-parties support their operations? How much
user traffic do they attract, in comparison to mainstream or real news
websites? In this paper, we perform a first of its kind investigation to answer
such questions regarding the online presence of fake news websites and
characterize their behavior in comparison to real news websites. Based on our
findings, we build a content-agnostic ML classifier for automatic detection of
fake news websites (i.e. accuracy) that are not yet included in manually

"Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of offensive content online
such as fake news, propaganda, misinformation, and disinformation. While
initially this was mostly about textual content, over time images and videos
gained popularity, as they are much easier to consume, attract more attention,
and spread further than text. As a result, researchers started leveraging
different modalities and combinations thereof to tackle online multimodal
offensive content. In this study, we offer a survey on the state-of-the-art on
multimodal disinformation detection covering various combinations of
modalities: text, images, speech, video, social media network structure, and
temporal information. Moreover, while some studies focused on factuality,
others investigated how harmful the content is. While these two components in
the definition of disinformation (i) factuality, and (ii) harmfulness, are
equally important, they are typically studied in isolation. Thus, we argue for
the need to tackle disinformation detection by taking into account multiple
modalities as well as both factuality and harmfulness, in the same framework.

"Political misinformation, astroturfing and organised trolling are online
malicious behaviours with significant real-world effects. Many previous
approaches examining these phenomena have focused on broad campaigns rather
than the small groups responsible for instigating or sustaining them. To reveal
latent (i.e., hidden) networks of cooperating accounts, we propose a novel
temporal window approach that relies on account interactions and metadata
alone. It detects groups of accounts engaging in various behaviours that, in
concert, come to execute different goal-based strategies, a number of which we
describe. The approach relies upon a pipeline that extracts relevant elements
from social media posts, infers connections between accounts based on criteria
matching the coordination strategies to build an undirected weighted network of
accounts, which is then mined for communities exhibiting high levels of
evidence of coordination using a novel community extraction method. We address
the temporal aspect of the data by using a windowing mechanism, which may be
suitable for near real-time application. We further highlight consistent
coordination with a sliding frame across multiple windows and application of a
decay factor. Our approach is compared with other recent similar processing
approaches and community detection methods and is validated against two
relevant datasets with ground truth data, using content, temporal, and network
analyses, as well as with the design, training and application of three
one-class classifiers built using the ground truth; its utility is furthermore
demonstrated in two case studies of contentious online discussions.","['Derek Weber', 'Frank Neumann']",2,0.7348362

initial run with BM25 and RM3; (2) we estimate credibility and misinformation

credibility and misinformation scores to re-rank documents in the initial run.
To estimate credibility scores, we implement a classifier which exploits

scores: weighted average, the distance among score vectors and rank fusion.","['Lucas Chaves Lima', 'Dustin Brandon Wright', 'Isabelle Augenstein', 'Maria Maistro']",1,0.5916543
"Differential privacy (DP) is getting attention as a privacy definition when
publishing statistics of a dataset. This paper focuses on the limitation that
DP inevitably causes two-sided error, which is not desirable for epidemic
analysis such as how many COVID-19 infected individuals visited location A. For
example, consider publishing misinformation that many infected people did not
visit location A, which may lead to miss decision-making that expands the
epidemic. To fix this issue, we propose a relaxation of DP, called asymmetric
differential privacy (ADP). We show that ADP can provide reasonable privacy
protection while achieving one-sided error. Finally, we conduct experiments to
evaluate the utility of proposed mechanisms for epidemic analysis using a
real-world dataset, which shows the practicality of our mechanisms.","['Shun Takagi', 'Yang Cao', 'Masatoshi Yoshikawa']",2,0.60471386
"Misinformation of COVID-19 is prevalent on social media as the pandemic
unfolds, and the associated risks are extremely high. Thus, it is critical to
detect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using
natural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting
misinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language
processing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)
to combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and
effectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with
fact checking. By augmenting the data using back-translation, we doubled the
sample size of the dataset and the DistilBERT model was able to obtain good
performance (accuracy: 0.972; areas under the curve: 0.993) in detecting
misinformation about COVID-19. Our model was also tested on a larger dataset
for AAAI2021 - COVID-19 Fake News Detection Shared Task and obtained good
performance (accuracy: 0.938; areas under the curve: 0.985). The performance on
both datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in
order to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve
model explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects
experiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE),
and text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE). The participants were
significantly more likely to trust and share information related to COVID-19 in
the TSE and TSESE conditions than in the T condition. Our results provided good
implications in detecting misinformation about COVID-19 and improving public
trust.","['Jackie Ayoub', 'X. Jessie Yang', 'Feng Zhou']",1,0.65503526

"The creation or manipulation of facial appearance through deep generative
approaches, known as DeepFake, have achieved significant progress and promoted
a wide range of benign and malicious applications, e.g., visual effect
assistance in movie and misinformation generation by faking famous persons. The
evil side of this new technique poses another popular study, i.e., DeepFake
detection aiming to identify the fake faces from the real ones. With the rapid
development of the DeepFake-related studies in the community, both sides have
formed the relationship of battleground, pushing the improvements of each other

Nevertheless, the overview of such battleground and the new direction is

problem, which comes in many different forms including hate speech, offensive
language, bullying and harassment, misinformation, spam, violence, graphic

moderate such content to limit societal harm, to comply with legislation, and
to create a more inclusive environment for their users. Researchers have
developed different methods for automatically detecting harmful content, often
focusing on specific sub-problems or on narrow communities, as what is
considered harmful often depends on the platform and on the context. We argue
that there is currently a dichotomy between what types of harmful content

automatically detect such content. We thus survey existing methods as well as
content moderation policies by online platforms in this light and we suggest
directions for future work.","['Arnav Arora', 'Preslav Nakov', 'Momchil Hardalov', 'Sheikh Muhammad Sarwar', 'Vibha Nayak', 'Yoan Dinkov', 'Dimitrina Zlatkova', 'Kyle Dent', 'Ameya Bhatawdekar', 'Guillaume Bouchard', 'Isabelle Augenstein']",3,0.58474827
"Images are an indispensable part of the news content we consume. Highly
emotional images from sources of misinformation can greatly influence our
judgements. We present two studies on the effects of emotional facial images on
users' perception of bias in news content and the credibility of sources. In

decisions. In study 2, we focus on sources' systematic emotional treatment of
specific politicians. Our results show that depending on the political
orientation of the source, the cumulative effect of angry facial emotions
impacts users' perceived content bias and source credibility. When sources
systematically portray specific politicians as angry, users are more likely to
find those sources as less credible and their content as more biased. These
results highlight how implicit visual propositions manifested by emotions in

"The enormous amount of discourse taking place online poses challenges to the
functioning of a civil and informed public sphere. Efforts to standardize
online discourse data, such as ClaimReview, are making available a wealth of
new data about potentially inaccurate claims, reviewed by third-party

discourse, the role of political elites in amplifying it, and its implications
for the integrity of the online information ecosystem. Unfortunately, the
semi-structured nature of much of this data presents significant challenges
when it comes to modeling and reasoning about online discourse. A key challenge
is relation extraction, which is the task of determining the semantic
relationships between named entities in a claim. Here we develop a novel
supervised learning method for relation extraction that combines graph
embedding techniques with path traversal on semantic dependency graphs. Our
approach is based on the intuitive observation that knowledge of the entities
along the path between the subject and object of a triple (e.g.
Washington,_D.C.}, and United_States_of_America) provides useful information
that can be leveraged for extracting its semantic relation (i.e. capitalOf). As

"As civil discourse increasingly takes place online, misinformation and the
polarization of news shared in online communities have become ever more
relevant concerns with real world harms across our society. Studying online
news sharing at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of content which
is shared by millions of users across thousands of communities. Therefore,
existing research has largely focused on specific communities or specific
interventions, such as bans. However, understanding the prevalence and spread
of misinformation and polarization more broadly, across thousands of online
communities, is critical for the development of governance strategies,
interventions, and community design. Here, we conduct the largest study of news
sharing on reddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million links spanning 4
years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check to
annotate links to news sources with their political bias and factualness. We
find that, compared to left-leaning communities, right-leaning communities have
105% more variance in the political bias of their news sources, and more links
to relatively-more biased sources, on average. We observe that reddit users'
voting and re-sharing behaviors generally decrease the visibility of extremely
biased and low factual content, which receives 20% fewer upvotes and 30% fewer
exposures from crossposts than more neutral or more factual content. This
suggests that reddit is more resilient to low factual content than Twitter. We
show that extremely biased and low factual content is very concentrated, with
99% of such content being shared in only 0.5% of communities, giving credence
to the recent strategy of community-wide bans and quarantines.","['Galen Weld', 'Maria Glenski', 'Tim Althoff']",10,0.7085639

we compare results from 2020 to prior years to note that, although bot accounts
still contribute to the emergence of echo-chambers, there is a transition from
state-sponsored campaigns to domestically emergent sources of distortion.
Furthermore, issues of public health can be confounded by political
orientation, especially from localized communities of actors who spread

"Continual (or ""incremental"") learning approaches are employed when additional
knowledge or tasks need to be learned from subsequent batches or from streaming
data. However these approaches are typically adversary agnostic, i.e., they do
not consider the possibility of a malicious attack. In our prior work, we
explored the vulnerabilities of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to the
perceptible misinformation. We now explore the vulnerabilities of other
regularization-based as well as generative replay-based continual learning
algorithms, and also extend the attack to imperceptible misinformation. We show
that an intelligent adversary can take advantage of a continual learning
algorithm's capabilities of retaining existing knowledge over time, and force
it to learn and retain deliberately introduced misinformation. To demonstrate
this vulnerability, we inject backdoor attack samples into the training data.
These attack samples constitute the misinformation, allowing the attacker to
capture control of the model at test time. We evaluate the extent of this
vulnerability on both rotated and split benchmark variants of the MNIST dataset
under two important domain and class incremental learning scenarios. We show
that the adversary can create a ""false memory"" about any task by inserting
carefully-designed backdoor samples to the test instances of that task thereby
controlling the amount of forgetting of any task of its choosing. Perhaps most
importantly, we show this vulnerability to be very acute and damaging: the
model memory can be easily compromised with the addition of backdoor samples
into as little as 1\% of the training data, even when the misinformation is
imperceptible to human eye.","['Muhammad Umer', 'Robi Polikar']",1,0.6651825
"Graphs are one of the most efficacious structures for representing datapoints

been modeled by a generalization of graphs known as hypergraphs. In
hypergraphs, the edges are defined by a set of nodes i.e., hyperedges to
demonstrate the higher order relationships between the data. However, there is
no explicit higher-order generalization for nodes themselves. In this work, we
introduce a novel generalization of graphs i.e., K-Nearest Hyperplanes graph
(KNH) where the nodes are defined by higher order Euclidean subspaces for
multi-view modeling of the nodes. In fact, in KNH, nodes are hyperplanes or
more precisely m-flats instead of datapoints. We experimentally evaluate the

"Can the look and the feel of a website give information about the
trustworthiness of an article? In this paper, we propose to use a promising,
yet neglected aspect in detecting the misinformativeness: the overall look of
the domain webpage. To capture this overall look, we take screenshots of news
articles served by either misinformative or trustworthy web domains and
leverage a tensor decomposition based semi-supervised classification technique.
The proposed approach i.e., VizFake is insensitive to a number of image
transformations such as converting the image to grayscale, vectorizing the
image and losing some parts of the screenshots. VizFake leverages a very small
amount of known labels, mirroring realistic and practical scenarios, where
labels (especially for known misinformative articles), are scarce and quickly
become dated. The F1 score of VizFake on a dataset of 50k screenshots of news
articles spanning more than 500 domains is roughly 85% using only 5% of ground
truth labels. Furthermore, tensor representations of VizFake, obtained in an
unsupervised manner, allow for exploratory analysis of the data that provides
valuable insights into the problem. Finally, we compare VizFake with deep
transfer learning, since it is a very popular black-box approach for image
classification and also well-known text text-based methods. VizFake achieves
competitive accuracy with deep transfer learning models while being two orders

and misinformation, and whether predominant credible information can suppress
misinformation for two prevention measures (i.e. topics), i.e. wearing masks
and social distancing using tweets collected from February 15 to June 30, 2020.
We trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to retrieve relevant tweets and
classify tweets containing credible information and misinformation for each
topic. Based on cross-correlation analyses of credible and misinformation time
series for both topics, we find that the previously predominant credible
information can lead to the decrease of misinformation (i.e. suppression) with
a time lag. The research findings provide empirical evidence for suppressing
misinformation with credible information in complex online environments and
suggest practical strategies for future information management during crises
and emergencies.","['Yan Wang', 'Shangde Gao', 'Wenyu Gao']",5,0.7454927
"This paper presents a secure reinforcement learning (RL) based control method
for unknown linear time-invariant cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that are
subjected to compositional attacks such as eavesdropping and covert attack. We
consider the attack scenario where the attacker learns about the dynamic model
during the exploration phase of the learning conducted by the designer to learn
a linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and thereafter, use such information to
conduct a covert attack on the dynamic system, which we refer to as doubly
learning-based control and attack (DLCA) framework. We propose a dynamic
camouflaging based attack-resilient reinforcement learning (ARRL) algorithm
which can learn the desired optimal controller for the dynamic system, and at
the same time, can inject sufficient misinformation in the estimation of system
dynamics by the attacker. The algorithm is accompanied by theoretical
guarantees and extensive numerical experiments on a consensus multi-agent
system and on a benchmark power grid model.","['Sayak Mukherjee', 'Veronica Adetola']",2,0.6277865

"When users on social media share content without considering its veracity,
they may unwittingly be spreading misinformation. In this work, we investigate
the design of lightweight interventions that nudge users to assess the accuracy
of information as they share it. Such assessment may deter users from posting
misinformation in the first place, and their assessments may also provide
useful guidance to friends aiming to assess those posts themselves. In support
of lightweight assessment, we first develop a taxonomy of the reasons why
people believe a news claim is or is not true; this taxonomy yields a checklist
that can be used at posting time. We conduct evaluations to demonstrate that
the checklist is an accurate and comprehensive encapsulation of people's
free-response rationales. In a second experiment, we study the effects of three
behavioral nudges -- 1) checkboxes indicating whether headings are accurate, 2)
tagging reasons (from our taxonomy) that a post is accurate via a checklist and
3) providing free-text rationales for why a headline is or is not accurate --
on people's intention of sharing the headline on social media. From an
experiment with 1668 participants, we find that both providing accuracy
assessment and rationale reduce the sharing of false content. They also reduce
the sharing of true content, but to a lesser degree that yields an overall
decrease in the fraction of shared content that is false. Our findings have
implications for designing social media and news sharing platforms that draw
from richer signals of content credibility contributed by users. In addition,
our validated taxonomy can be used by platforms and researchers as a way to
gather rationales in an easier fashion than free-response.","['Farnaz Jahanbakhsh', 'Amy X. Zhang', 'Adam J. Berinsky', 'Gordon Pennycook', 'David G. Rand', 'David R. Karger']",3,0.72365105
"The spread of misinformation can cause social confusion. The authenticity of
information on a social networking service (SNS) is unknown, and false
information can be easily spread. Consequently, many studies have been
conducted on methods to control the spread of misinformation on social
networking sites. However, few studies have examined the impact of the spread
of misinformation and its corrections on society. This study models the impact
of the reduction of misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information
on social disruption, and it identifies the features of this impact. In this
study, we analyzed misinformation regarding the shortage of toilet paper during
the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, its corrections, and the excessive purchasing
caused by this information. First, we analyze the amount of misinformation and
corrective information spread on SNS, and we create a regression model to
estimate the real-world impact of misinformation and its correction. This model
is used to analyze the change in real-world impact corresponding to the change
in the diffusion of misinformation and corrective information. Our analysis
shows that the corrective information was spread to a much greater extent than
the misinformation. In addition, our model reveals that the corrective
information was what caused the excessive purchasing behavior. As a result of
our further analysis, we found that the amount of diffusion of corrective
information required to minimize the impact on the real world depends on the
amount of the diffusion of misinformation.","['Ryusuke Iizuka', 'Fujio Toriumi', 'Mao Nishiguchi', 'Masanori Takano', 'Mitsuo Yoshida']",0,0.69448864

individual objects in an image with textual claims, without explicit

"In social networks, users often engage with like-minded peers. This selective
exposure to opinions might result in echo chambers, i.e., political
fragmentation and social polarization of user interactions. When echo chambers
form, opinions have a bimodal distribution with two peaks on opposite sides. In
certain issues, where either extreme positions contain a degree of
misinformation, neutral consensus is preferable for promoting discourse. In
this paper, we use an opinion dynamics model that naturally forms echo chambers
in order to find a feedback mechanism that bridges these communities and leads
to a neutral consensus. We introduce random dynamical nudge (RDN), which
presents each agent with input from a random selection of other agents'
opinions and does not require surveillance of every person's opinions. Our
computational results in two different models suggest that the RDN leads to a
unimodal distribution of opinions centered around the neutral consensus.
Furthermore, the RDN is effective both for preventing the formation of echo
chambers and also for depolarizing existing echo chambers. Due to the simple
and robust nature of the RDN, social media networks might be able to implement
a version of this self-feedback mechanism, when appropriate, to prevent the
segregation of online communities on complex social issues.","['Christopher Brian Currin', 'Sebastián Vallejo Vera', 'Ali Khaledi-Nasab']",3,0.64935577

"In 2019, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases reached the highest number

propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay
and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for
antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine
messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have
considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags),
and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of
photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are
not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components

propose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual
information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to

antivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can
generate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble
method is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To
evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset

"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their
homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection,
which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation.
Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging,
and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the
evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts.
Results: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the
proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier
metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores
between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy
theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets
demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets
and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated
conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. Conclusions: Although we
focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is
not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation
in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to
counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized
misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to
target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become
incorporated.","['Dax Gerts', 'Courtney D. Shelley', 'Nidhi Parikh', 'Travis Pitts', 'Chrysm Watson Ross', 'Geoffrey Fairchild', 'Nidia Yadria Vaquera Chavez', 'Ashlynn R. Daughton']",3,0.79103035
"This paper presents TrollHunter2020, a real-time detection mechanism we used
to hunt for trolling narratives on Twitter during the 2020 U.S. elections.
Trolling narratives form on Twitter as alternative explanations of polarizing
events like the 2020 U.S. elections with the goal to conduct information
operations or provoke emotional response. Detecting trolling narratives thus is
an imperative step to preserve constructive discourse on Twitter and remove an
influx of misinformation. Using existing techniques, this takes time and a
wealth of data, which, in a rapidly changing election cycle with high stakes,
might not be available. To overcome this limitation, we developed
TrollHunter2020 to hunt for trolls in real-time with several dozens of trending
Twitter topics and hashtags corresponding to the candidates' debates, the
election night, and the election aftermath. TrollHunter2020 collects trending
data and utilizes a correspondence analysis to detect meaningful relationships
between the top nouns and verbs used in constructing trolling narratives while
they emerge on Twitter. Our results suggest that the TrollHunter2020 indeed
captures the emerging trolling narratives in a very early stage of an unfolding
polarizing event. We discuss the utility of TrollHunter2020 for early detection
of information operations or trolling and the implications of its use in
supporting a constrictive discourse on the platform around polarizing topics.","['Peter Jachim', 'Filipo Sharevski', 'Emma Pieroni']",10,0.658736

"As the world becomes more and more interconnected, our everyday objects
become part of the Internet of Things, and our lives get more and more mirrored
in virtual reality, where every piece of~information, including misinformation,

Currently, the most effective methods for source localization are based on
sensors which provide the times at which they detect the~spread. We investigate
the problem of the optimal placement of such sensors in complex networks and
propose a new graph measure, called Collective Betweenness, which we compare
against four other metrics. Extensive numerical tests are performed on
different types of complex networks over the wide ranges of densities of
sensors and stochasticities of signal. In these tests, we discovered clear
difference in comparative performance of the investigated optimal placement
methods between real or scale-free synthetic networks versus narrow degree
distribution networks. The former have a clear region for any given method's
dominance in contrast to the latter where the performance maps are less
homogeneous. We find that while choosing the best method is very network and
spread dependent, there are two methods that consistently stand out. High

"An infodemic is an emerging phenomenon caused by an overabundance of

debuted with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and bots (i.e., automated
accounts controlled by a set of algorithms) that are suspected of spreading the
infodemic. Although previous research has revealed that bots played a central
role in spreading misinformation during major political events, how bots
behaved during the infodemic is unclear. In this paper, we examined the roles
of bots in the case of the COVID-19 infodemic and the diffusion of non-credible

"A rapidly evolving situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant
challenge for AI/ML models because of its unpredictability. %The most reliable
indicator of the pandemic spreading has been the number of test positive cases.
However, the tests are both incomplete (due to untested asymptomatic cases) and
late (due the lag from the initial contact event, worsening symptoms, and test
results). Social media can complement physical test data due to faster and
higher coverage, but they present a different challenge: significant amounts of
noise, misinformation and disinformation. We believe that social media can
become good indicators of pandemic, provided two conditions are met. The first
(True Novelty) is the capture of new, previously unknown, information from
unpredictably evolving situations. The second (Fact vs. Fiction) is the
distinction of verifiable facts from misinformation and disinformation. Social
media information that satisfy those two conditions are called live knowledge.
We apply evidence-based knowledge acquisition (EBKA) approach to collect,

an environmental direction. We show that, when the fraction of informed
individuals is small, by increasing the noise in communication, similarly to
the Viscek model, the model shows a discontinuous order-disorder transition
with strong finite size effects. In contrast, for large fraction of informed

phase without passing any phase transition. The ordered phase is composed of
two phases separated by a discontinuous transition. Informed collective motion,
in which the population collectively infers the correct environmental
direction, occurs for high fraction of informed individuals. When the fraction
of informed individuals is low, misinformed collective motion, where the
population fails to find the environmental direction becomes stable as well.

"Online Social Media (OSM) platforms such as Twitter, Facebook are extensively
exploited by the users of these platforms for spreading the (mis)information to
a large audience effortlessly at a rapid pace. It has been observed that the
misinformation can cause panic, fear, and financial loss to society. Thus, it
is important to detect and control the misinformation in such platforms before
it spreads to the masses. In this work, we focus on rumors, which is one type
of misinformation (other types are fake news, hoaxes, etc). One way to control
the spread of the rumors is by identifying users who are possibly the rumor
spreaders, that is, users who are often involved in spreading the rumors. Due
to the lack of availability of rumor spreaders labeled dataset (which is an
expensive task), we use publicly available PHEME dataset, which contains rumor
and non-rumor tweets information, and then apply a weak supervised learning
approach to transform the PHEME dataset into rumor spreaders dataset. We
utilize three types of features, that is, user, text, and ego-network features,
before applying various supervised learning approaches. In particular, to
exploit the inherent network property in this dataset (user-user reply graph),
we explore Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), a type of Graph Neural Network
(GNN) technique. We compare GCN results with the other approaches: SVM, RF, and
LSTM. Extensive experiments performed on the rumor spreaders dataset, where we
achieve up to 0.864 value for F1-Score and 0.720 value for AUC-ROC, shows the
effectiveness of our methodology for identifying possible rumor spreaders using
the GCN technique.","['Shakshi Sharma', 'Rajesh Sharma']",4,0.6522325
"The sudden widespread menace created by the present global pandemic COVID-19
has had an unprecedented effect on our lives. Man-kind is going through
humongous fear and dependence on social media like never before. Fear
inevitably leads to panic, speculations, and the spread of misinformation. Many
governments have taken measures to curb the spread of such misinformation for
public well being. Besides global measures, to have effective outreach, systems
for demographically local languages have an important role to play in this
effort. Towards this, we propose an approach to detect fake news about COVID-19
early on from social media, such as tweets, for multiple Indic-Languages
besides English. In addition, we also create an annotated dataset of Hindi and
Bengali tweet for fake news detection. We propose a BERT based model augmented
with additional relevant features extracted from Twitter to identify fake
tweets. To expand our approach to multiple Indic languages, we resort to mBERT
based model which is fine-tuned over created dataset in Hindi and Bengali. We
also propose a zero-shot learning approach to alleviate the data scarcity issue
for such low resource languages. Through rigorous experiments, we show that our
approach reaches around 89% F-Score in fake tweet detection which supercedes
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark
for two Indic-Languages, Hindi and Bengali. Using our annotated data, our model
achieves about 79% F-Score in Hindi and 81% F-Score for Bengali Tweets. Our
zero-shot model achieves about 81% F-Score in Hindi and 78% F-Score for Bengali
Tweets without any annotated data, which clearly indicates the efficacy of our
approach.","['Debanjana Kar', 'Mohit Bhardwaj', 'Suranjana Samanta', 'Amar Prakash Azad']",8,0.70259035
"Misinformation/disinformation about COVID-19 has been rampant on social media
around the world. In this study, we investigate COVID-19 misinformation/
disinformation on social media in multiple languages - Farsi (Persian),
Chinese, and English, about multiple countries - Iran, China, and the United
States (US), and on multiple platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
Weibo, and WhatsApp. Misinformation, especially about a global pandemic, is a
global problem yet it is common for studies of COVID-19 misinformation on
social media to focus on a single language, like English, a single country,
like the US, or a single platform, like Twitter. We utilized opportunistic
sampling to compile 200 specific items of viral and yet debunked misinformation
across these languages, countries and platforms emerged between January 1 and
August 31. We then categorized this collection based both on the topics of the
misinformation and the underlying roots of that misinformation. Our
multi-cultural and multilingual team observed that the nature of COVID-19
misinformation on social media varied in substantial ways across different
languages/countries depending on the cultures, beliefs/religions, popularity of
social media, types of platforms, freedom of speech and the power of people
versus governments. We observe that politics is at the root of most of the
collected misinformation across all three languages in this dataset. We further
observe the different impact of government restrictions on platforms and
platform restrictions on content in Iran, China, and the US and their impact on
a key question of our age: how do we control misinformation without silencing

"The digital spread of misinformation is one of the leading threats to
democracy, public health, and the global economy. Popular strategies for
mitigating misinformation include crowdsourcing, machine learning, and media
literacy programs that require social media users to classify news in binary
terms as either true or false. However, research on peer influence suggests
that framing decisions in binary terms can amplify judgment errors and limit
social learning, whereas framing decisions in probabilistic terms can reliably
improve judgments. In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer
networks that collaboratively evaluate the veracity of news by communicating
either binary or probabilistic judgments. Exchanging probabilistic estimates of
news veracity substantially improved individual and group judgments, with the
effect of eliminating polarization in news evaluation. By contrast, exchanging
binary classifications reduced social learning and entrenched polarization. The
benefits of probabilistic social learning are robust to participants'
education, gender, race, income, religion, and partisanship.","['Douglas Guilbeault', 'Samuel Woolley', 'Joshua Becker']",3,0.67317605

"Although many fact-checking systems have been developed in academia and
industry, fake news is still proliferating on social media. These systems
mostly focus on fact-checking but usually neglect online users who are the main
drivers of the spread of misinformation. How can we use fact-checked
information to improve users' consciousness of fake news to which they are
exposed? How can we stop users from spreading fake news? To tackle these
questions, we propose a novel framework to search for fact-checking articles,
which address the content of an original tweet (that may contain
misinformation) posted by online users. The search can directly warn fake news
posters and online users (e.g. the posters' followers) about misinformation,
discourage them from spreading fake news, and scale up verified content on
social media. Our framework uses both text and images to search for
fact-checking articles, and achieves promising results on real-world datasets.

"Recently, the term ""fake news"" has been broadly and extensively utilized for
disinformation, misinformation, hoaxes, propaganda, satire, rumors, click-bait,
and junk news. It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a
new system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on
several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There
are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The
Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions
between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and
then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on
all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake
News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to
generate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with
well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the
news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy
are the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were
indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. We
compared FaNDS to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be
more sensitive in discovering fake news items.","['Jiawei Xu', 'Vladimir Zadorozhny', 'Danchen Zhang', 'John Grant']",4,0.7094367
"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every human activity and, because of
the urgency of finding the proper responses to such an unprecedented emergency,
it generated a diffused societal debate. The online version of this discussion
was not exempted by the presence of d/misinformation campaigns, but differently
from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -- intentional or
not -- flow of false information put at severe risk the public health, reducing
the effectiveness of governments' countermeasures. In the present manuscript,
we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate
on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities.
In order to extract the discursive communities, we focus on verified users,
i.e. accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We thus infer
the various discursive communities based on how verified users are perceived by
standard ones: if two verified accounts are considered as similar by non
unverified ones, we link them in the network of certified accounts. We first
observe that, beside being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion
show a clear division in what results to be different political groups. At this
point, by using a commonly available fact-checking software (NewsGuard), we
assess the reputation of the pieces of news exchanged. We filter the network of
retweets (i.e. users re-broadcasting the same elementary piece of information,
or tweet) from random noise and check the presence of messages displaying an
url. The impact of misinformation posts reaches the 22.1% in the right and
center-right wing community and its contribution is even stronger in absolute
numbers, due to the activity of this group: 96% of all non reputable urls
shared by political groups come from this community.","['Guido Caldarelli', 'Rocco de Nicola', 'Marinella Petrocchi', 'Manuel Pratelli', 'Fabio Saracco']",3,0.79358816

vulnerability to online misinformation by studying news sharing behavior on
Twitter. While our results confirm prior findings that online misinformation
sharing is strongly correlated with right-leaning partisanship, we also uncover
a similar, though weaker trend among left-leaning users. Because of the
correlation between a user's partisanship and their position within a partisan
echo chamber, these types of influence are confounded. To disentangle their
effects, we perform a regression analysis and find that vulnerability to
misinformation is most strongly influenced by partisanship for both left- and

study online chatter, especially in the run up to important voting events, like
in the case of the upcoming November 3, 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.
Limited access to social media data is often the first barrier to impede,

year encompasses hundreds of millions of tweets and tracks all salient U.S.
politics trends, actors, and events between 2019 and 2020. It predates and
spans the whole period of Republican and Democratic primaries, with real-time
tracking of all presidential contenders of both sides of the isle. After that,
it focuses on presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Our dataset

"The authors of fake news often use facts from verified news sources and mix
them with misinformation to create confusion and provoke unrest among the
readers. The spread of fake news can thereby have serious implications on our

algorithm of search results that have misinformation stances are positively
correlated with the stance of search queries and customers' evaluation of items
(ratings and reviews), (2) misinformation stances of search results are neither
affected by users' activities nor by interacting (browsing, wish-listing,

to 1) the rapid developments in the field of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep
Learning (DL) algorithms in creating realistic-looking yet fake digital content
(such as text, images, and videos), 2) the ability to customize the content
feeds and to create a polarized so-called ""filter-bubbles"" leveraging the
availability of the big-data. Therefore, there is an ethical need to combat the
flow of fake content. This paper attempts to resolve some of the aspects of
this combat by presenting a high-level overview of TRUSTD, a blockchain and
collective signature-based ecosystem to help content creators in getting their
content backed by the community, and to help users judge on the credibility and
correctness of these contents.","['Zakwan Jaroucheh', 'Mohamad Alissa', 'William J Buchanan']",0,0.6646168
"Misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine
safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. The
crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed
as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the
assessments of experts at scale. In this work, we investigate news credibility
assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between
them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken
from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and Upwork workers---as well as 2
expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news
articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between
public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences
in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and
political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned
to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication.
Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert
criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may
contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the
gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these
findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd
processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content.","['Md Momen Bhuiyan', 'Amy X. Zhang', 'Connie Moon Sehat', 'Tanushree Mitra']",3,0.6796372
"Progress in generative modelling, especially generative adversarial networks,
have made it possible to efficiently synthesize and alter media at scale.
Malicious individuals now rely on these machine-generated media, or deepfakes,
to manipulate social discourse. In order to ensure media authenticity, existing
research is focused on deepfake detection. Yet, the adversarial nature of
frameworks used for generative modeling suggests that progress towards
detecting deepfakes will enable more realistic deepfake generation. Therefore,
it comes at no surprise that developers of generative models are under the
scrutiny of stakeholders dealing with misinformation campaigns. At the same
time, generative models have a lot of positive applications. As such, there is
a clear need to develop tools that ensure the transparent use of generative
modeling, while minimizing the harm caused by malicious applications.
  Our technique optimizes over the source of entropy of each generative model
to probabilistically attribute a deepfake to one of the models. We evaluate our
method on the seminal example of face synthesis, demonstrating that our
approach achieves 97.62% attribution accuracy, and is less sensitive to
perturbations and adversarial examples. We discuss the ethical implications of
our work, identify where our technique can be used, and highlight that a more
meaningful legislative framework is required for a more transparent and ethical
use of generative modeling. Finally, we argue that model developers should be
capable of claiming plausible deniability and propose a second framework to do
so -- this allows a model developer to produce evidence that they did not
produce media that they are being accused of having produced.","['Baiwu Zhang', 'Jin Peng Zhou', 'Ilia Shumailov', 'Nicolas Papernot']",7,0.76867485
"Many governments have managed to control their COVID-19 outbreak with a
simple message: keep the effective '$R$ number' $R<1$ to prevent widespread
contagion and flatten the curve. This raises the question whether a similar
policy could control dangerous online 'infodemics' of information,
misinformation and disinformation. Here we show, using multi-platform data from
the COVID-19 infodemic, that its online spreading instead encompasses a
different dynamical regime where communities and users within and across
independent platforms, sporadically form temporary active links on similar
timescales to the viral spreading. This allows material that might have died
out, to evolve and even mutate. This has enabled niche networks that were
already successfully spreading hate and anti-vaccination material, to rapidly
become global super-spreaders of narratives featuring fake COVID-19 treatments,
anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories. We derive new tools that
incorporate these coupled social-viral dynamics, including an online $R$, to
help prevent infodemic spreading at all scales: from spreading across platforms
(e.g. Facebook, 4Chan) to spreading within a given subpopulation, or community,
or topic. By accounting for similar social and viral timescales, the same
mathematical theory also offers a quantitative description of other
unconventional infection profiles such as rumors spreading in financial markets
and colds spreading in schools.","['N. F. Johnson', 'N. Velasquez', 'O. K. Jha', 'H. Niyazi', 'R. Leahy', 'N. Johnson Restrepo', 'R. Sear', 'P. Manrique', 'Y. Lupu', 'P. Devkota', 'S. Wuchty']",5,0.7112577
"Recently, news consumption using online news portals has increased
exponentially due to several reasons, such as low cost and easy accessibility.
However, such online platforms inadvertently also become the cause of spreading
false information across the web. They are being misused quite frequently as a
medium to disseminate misinformation and hoaxes. Such malpractices call for a
robust automatic fake news detection system that can keep us at bay from such
misinformation and hoaxes. We propose a robust yet simple fake news detection
system, leveraging the tools for paraphrasing, grammar-checking, and
word-embedding. In this paper, we try to the potential of these tools in
jointly unearthing the authenticity of a news article. Notably, we leverage
Spinbot (for paraphrasing), Grammarly (for grammar-checking), and GloVe (for
word-embedding) tools for this purpose. Using these tools, we were able to
extract novel features that could yield state-of-the-art results on the Fake

"Ten years ago, DARPA launched the 'Network Challenge', more commonly known as
the 'DARPA Red Balloon Challenge'. Ten red weather balloons were fixed at
unknown locations in the US. An open challenge was launched to locate all ten,
the first to do so would be declared the winner receiving a cash prize. A team
from MIT Media Lab was able to locate them all within 9 hours using social
media and a novel reward scheme that rewarded viral recruitment. This
achievement was rightly seen as proof of the remarkable ability of social
media, then relatively nascent, to solve real world problems such as
large-scale spatial search. Upon reflection, however, the challenge was also
remarkable as it succeeded despite many efforts to provide false information on
the location of the balloons. At the time the false reports were filtered based
on manual inspection of visual proof and comparing the IP addresses of those
reporting with the purported coordinates of the balloons. In the ten years
since, misinformation on social media has grown in prevalence and
sophistication to be one of the defining social issues of our time. Seen
differently we can cast the misinformation observed in the Red Balloon
Challenge, and unexpected adverse effects in other social mobilisation
challenges subsequently, not as bugs but as essential features. We further
investigate the role of the increasing levels of political polarisation in
modulating social mobilisation. We confirm that polarisation not only impedes
the overall success of mobilisation, but also leads to a low reachability to
oppositely polarised states, significantly hampering recruitment. We find that
diversifying geographic pathways of social influence are key to circumvent
barriers of political mobilisation and can boost the success of new open
challenges.","['Alex Rutherford', 'Manuel Cebrian', 'Inho Hong', 'Iyad Rahwan']",5,0.56113297
"Misinformation is an ever increasing problem that is difficult to solve for
the research community and has a negative impact on the society at large. Very
recently, the problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach to
scale up labeling efforts: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead
of relying on a few experts, a crowd of (non-expert) judges is exploited. We
follow the same approach to study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and
reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic. We
specifically target statements related to the COVID-19 health emergency, that
is still ongoing at the time of the study and has arguably caused an increase
of the amount of misinformation that is spreading online (a phenomenon for
which the term ""infodemic"" has been used). By doing so, we are able to address
(mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal issue like
health and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done: two issues
that have not been analyzed in related work. In our experiment, crowd workers
are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements, as well as to provide
evidence for the assessments as a URL and a text justification. Besides showing
that the crowd is able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements,
we also report results on many different aspects, including: agreement among
workers, the effect of different aggregation functions, of scales

"Health misinformation has been found to be prevalent on social media,
particularly in new public health crises in which there is limited scientific
information. However, social media can also play a role in limiting and
refuting health misinformation. Using as a case study US President Donald
Trump's controversial comments about the promise and power of UV light- and
disinfectant-based treatments, this data memo examines how these comments were
discussed and responded to on Twitter. We find that these comments fell into
established politically partisan narratives and dominated discussion of both
politics and COVID in the days following. Contestation of the comments was much
more prevalent than support. Supporters attacked media coverage in line with
existing Trump narratives. Contesters responded with humour and shared
mainstream media coverage condemning the comments. These practices would have
strengthened the original misinformation through repetition and done little to
construct a successful refutation for those who might have believed them. This
research adds much-needed knowledge to our understanding of the information

"The COVID-19 pandemic has been the subject of a vast amount of
misinformation, particularly in digital information environments, and major
social media platforms recently publicized some of the countermeasures they are
adopting. This presents an opportunity to examine the nature of the
misinformation and disinformation being produced, and the theoretical and
technological paradigm used to counter it. I argue that this approach is based
on a conception of misinformation as epistemic pollution that can only justify
a limited and potentially inadequate response , and that some of the measures
undertaken in practice outrun this. In fact, social networks manage ecological
and architectural conditions that influence discourse on their platforms in
ways that should motivate reconsideration of the justifications that ground
epistemic interventions to combat misinformation, and the types of intervention
that they warrant. The editorial role of platforms should not be framed solely
as the management of epistemic pollution, but instead as managing the epistemic
environment in which narratives and social epistemic processes take place.
There is an element of inevitable epistemic paternalism involved in this, and
exploration of the independent constraints on its justifiability can help
determine proper limits of its exercise in practice.",['Andrew Buzzell'],0,0.630357

"Research on infodemics, i.e., the rapid spread of (mis)information related to

intermediate credibility, were shared more often, on average, than links to
non-credible sources. These results suggest that more ambiguous forms of
misinformation about COVID-19 may be more likely to be disseminated through
credible sources when compared to other health topics. Furthermore, the
assumption that credibility is an adequate proxy for false content may
overestimate the prevalence of false content online: less than 25% of posts

"Photorealistic image generation has reached a new level of quality due to the

such deepfakes, the malicious use of generated media, raises concerns about

seek a proactive and sustainable solution on deepfake detection, that is

  Our approach is simple and effective. We first embed artificial fingerprints
into training data, then validate a surprising discovery on the transferability
of such fingerprints from training data to generative models, which in turn
appears in the generated deepfakes. Experiments show that our fingerprinting
solution (1) holds for a variety of cutting-edge generative models, (2) leads
to a negligible side effect on generation quality, (3) stays robust against
image-level and model-level perturbations, (4) stays hard to be detected by
adversaries, and (5) converts deepfake detection and attribution into trivial
tasks and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art baselines. Our solution

"Social media platforms have been extensively used during natural disasters.
However, most prior work has lacked focus on studying their usage during
disasters in the Global South, where Internet access and social media
utilization differs from developing countries. In this paper, we study how
social media was used in the aftermath of the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit
Mexico on September 19 of 2017 (known as the #19S earthquake). We conduct an
analysis of how participants utilized social media platforms in the #19S
aftermath. Our research extends investigations of crisis informatics by: 1)
examining how participants used different social media platforms in the
aftermath of a natural disaster in a Global South country; 2) uncovering how
individuals developed their own processes to verify news reports using an
on-the-ground citizen approach; 3) revealing how people developed their own
mechanisms to deal with outdated information. For this, we surveyed 356 people.
Additionally, we analyze one month of activity from: Facebook (12,606 posts),
Twitter (2,909,109 tweets), Slack (28,782 messages), and GitHub (2,602
commits). This work offers a multi-platform view on user behavior to coordinate
relief efforts, reduce the spread of misinformation and deal with obsolete
information which seems to have been essential to help in the coordination and
efficiency of relief efforts. Finally, based on our findings, we make
recommendations for technology design to improve the effectiveness of social
media use during crisis response efforts and mitigate the spread of
misinformation across social media platforms.","['Claudia Flores-Saviaga', 'Saiph Savage']",5,0.69137454

"Query autocompletions help users of search engines to speed up their searches
by recommending completions of partially typed queries in a drop down box.
These recommended query autocompletions are usually based on large logs of
queries that were previously entered by the search engine's users. Therefore,
misinformation entered -- either accidentally or purposely to manipulate the
search engine -- might end up in the search engine's recommendations,
potentially harming organizations, individuals, and groups of people. This
paper proposes an alternative approach for generating query autocompletions by
extracting anchor texts from a large web crawl, without the need to use query

"Social and technical trends have significantly changed methods for evaluating
and disseminating computing research. Traditional venues for reviewing and
publishing, such as conferences and journals, worked effectively in the past.
Recently, trends have created new opportunities but also put new pressures on
the process of review and dissemination. For example, many conferences have
seen large increases in the number of submissions. Likewise, dissemination of
research ideas has become dramatically through publication venues such as
arXiv.org and social media networks. While these trends predate COVID-19, the
pandemic could accelerate longer term changes. Based on interviews with leading
academics in computing research, our findings include: (1) Trends impacting
computing research are largely positive and have increased the participation,
scope, accessibility, and speed of the research process. (2) Challenges remain
in securing the integrity of the process, including addressing ways to scale
the review process, avoiding attempts to misinform or confuse the dissemination
of results, and ensuring fairness and broad participation in the process
itself. Based on these findings, we recommend: (1) Regularly polling members of
the computing research community, including program and general conference
chairs, journal editors, authors, reviewers, etc., to identify specific
challenges they face to better understand these issues. (2) An influential
body, such as the Computing Research Association regularly issues a ""State of

"Due to its impact, COVID-19 has been stressing the academy to search for
curing, mitigating, or controlling it. However, when it comes to controlling,
there are still few studies focused on under-reporting estimates. It is
believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual
mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation.
Therefore, the objective of this work is to estimate the under-reporting of
cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the Infogripe
on notification of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology
is based on the concepts of inertia and the use of event detection techniques
to study the time series of hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases
of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in
SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent
years (2016 to 2019) derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The
results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and
that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil.

"Due to the convenience of access-on-demand to information and business
solutions, mobile apps have become an important asset in the digital world. In
the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response
effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases
(e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location
tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc.
While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even
malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different
apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and
investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt
to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics
with the objective to provide a First taxonomy of Covid-related apps,
broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall,
our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the
knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly
to the Covid-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2)
Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve
to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data
from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than
standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in
the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past

"It is a widely accepted fact that state-sponsored Twitter accounts operated
during the 2016 US presidential election, spreading millions of tweets with
misinformation and inflammatory political content. Whether these social media
campaigns of the so-called ""troll"" accounts were able to manipulate public
opinion is still in question. Here, we quantify the influence of troll accounts
on Twitter by analyzing 152.5 million tweets (by 9.9 million users) from that
period. The data contain original tweets from 822 troll accounts identified as
such by Twitter itself. We construct and analyse a very large interaction graph
of 9.3 million nodes and 169.9 million edges using graph analysis techniques,
along with a game-theoretic centrality measure. Then, we quantify the influence
of all Twitter accounts on the overall information exchange as is defined by
the retweet cascades. We provide a global influence ranking of all Twitter
accounts and we find that one troll account appears in the top-100 and four in
the top-1000. This combined with other findings presented in this paper
constitute evidence that the driving force of virality and influence in the
network came from regular users - users who have not been classified as trolls
by Twitter. On the other hand, we find that on average, troll accounts were
tens of times more influential than regular users were. Moreover, 23% and 22%
of regular accounts in the top-100 and top-1000 respectively, have now been
suspended by Twitter. This raises questions about their authenticity and

"Malicious actors create inauthentic social media accounts controlled in part
by algorithms, known as social bots, to disseminate misinformation and agitate

detect abuse, novel bots with diverse behaviors evade detection. We show that
different types of bots are characterized by different behavioral features. As
a result, supervised learning techniques suffer severe performance
deterioration when attempting to detect behaviors not observed in the training

with a significant amount of new annotations, which are expensive to obtain. To
address these issues, we propose a new supervised learning method that trains
classifiers specialized for each class of bots and combines their decisions
through the maximum rule. The ensemble of specialized classifiers (ESC) can
better generalize, leading to an average improvement of 56\% in F1 score for
unseen accounts across datasets. Furthermore, novel bot behaviors are learned
with fewer labeled examples during retraining. We deployed ESC in the newest

"Information diffusion prediction is a fundamental task for understanding the
information propagation process. It has wide applications in such as
misinformation spreading prediction and malicious account detection. Previous
works either concentrate on utilizing the context of a single diffusion
sequence or using the social network among users for information diffusion
prediction. However, the diffusion paths of different messages naturally
constitute a dynamic diffusion graph. For one thing, previous works cannot
jointly utilize both the social network and diffusion graph for prediction,
which is insufficient to model the complexity of the diffusion process and
results in unsatisfactory prediction performance. For another, they cannot
learn users' dynamic preferences. Intuitively, users' preferences are changing
as time goes on and users' personal preference determines whether the user will
repost the information. Thus, it is beneficial to consider users' dynamic
preferences in information diffusion prediction.
  In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph convolutional
network (DyHGCN) to jointly learn the structural characteristics of the social
graph and dynamic diffusion graph. Then, we encode the temporal information
into the heterogeneous graph to learn the users' dynamic preferences. Finally,
we apply multi-head attention to capture the context-dependency of the current
diffusion path to facilitate the information diffusion prediction task.
Experimental results show that DyHGCN significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on three public datasets, which shows the effectiveness
of the proposed model.","['Chunyuan Yuan', 'Jiacheng Li', 'Wei Zhou', 'Yijun Lu', 'Xiaodan Zhang', 'Songlin Hu']",2,0.70676625
"Debunking misinformation is an important and time-critical task as there
could be adverse consequences when misinformation is not quashed promptly.
However, the usual supervised approach to debunking via misinformation

paper, we postulate that misinformation itself has higher perplexity compared
to truthful statements, and propose to leverage the perplexity to debunk false
claims in an unsupervised manner. First, we extract reliable evidence from
scientific and news sources according to sentence similarity to the claims.
Second, we prime a language model with the extracted evidence and finally
evaluate the correctness of given claims based on the perplexity scores at
debunking time. We construct two new COVID-19-related test sets, one is
scientific, and another is political in content, and empirically verify that
our system performs favorably compared to existing systems. We are releasing
these datasets publicly to encourage more research in debunking misinformation

"Public health practitioners and policy makers grapple with the challenge of
devising effective message-based interventions for debunking public health
misinformation in cyber communities. ""Framing"" and ""personalization"" of the
message is one of the key features for devising a persuasive messaging
strategy. For an effective health communication, it is imperative to focus on
""preference-based framing"" where the preferences of the target sub-community
are taken into consideration. To achieve that, it is important to understand
and hence characterize the target sub-communities in terms of their social
interactions. In the context of health-related misinformation, vaccination
remains to be the most prevalent topic of discord. Hence, in this paper, we
conduct a sociolinguistic analysis of the two competing vaccination communities
on Twitter: ""pro-vaxxers"" or individuals who believe in the effectiveness of
vaccinations, and ""anti-vaxxers"" or individuals who are opposed to
vaccinations. Our data analysis show significant linguistic variation between
the two communities in terms of their usage of linguistic intensifiers,

"Most of the information operations involve users who may foster polarization

consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability.
Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social
response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law
distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and
topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users
in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable

"With the emergence and rapid proliferation of social media platforms and
social networking sites, recent years have witnessed a surge of misinformation
spreading in our daily life. Drawing on a large-scale dataset which covers more
than 1.4M posts and 18M comments, we investigate the propagation of two
distinct narratives--(i) conspiracy information, whose claims are generally
unsubstantiated and thus referred as misinformation to some extent, and (ii)
scientific information, whose origins are generally readily identifiable and
verifiable--in an online social media platform. We find that conspiracy
cascades tend to propagate in a multigenerational branching process while
science cascades are more likely to grow in a breadth-first manner.
Specifically, conspiracy information triggers larger cascades, involves more
users and generations, persists longer, is more viral and bursty than science
information. Content analysis reveals that conspiracy cascades contain more
negative words and emotional words which convey anger, fear, disgust, surprise
and trust. We also find that conspiracy cascades are more concerned with
political and controversial topics. After applying machine learning models, we
achieve an AUC score of nearly 90% in discriminating conspiracy from science
narratives.
  We find that conspiracy cascades are more likely to be controlled by a
broader set of users than science cascades, imposing new challenges on the
management of misinformation. Although political affinity is thought to affect
the consumption of misinformation, there is very little evidence that political

min--max optimization. Journal of Global Optimization, 66(2), 225--262). In
this setting, the leader of the upper level problem aims at restricting the
follower's decisions by minimizing an objective function, which the follower
intends to maximize in the lower level problem by making decisions still
available to her. The $x$-space algorithm solves upper and lower bound problems
consecutively until convergence, and requires the dualization of an
approximation of the follower's problem in formulating the lower bound problem.
We first reformulate the lower bound problem using the properties of an optimal
solution to the original formulation, which makes the dualization step
unnecessary. The reformulation makes possible the integration of a greedy
covering heuristic into the solution scheme, which results in a considerable
increase in the efficiency. The new algorithm referred to as the improved

two other bilevel problems: zero-one knapsack problem with interdiction and

"Social Networks (SNs) have been gradually applied by utility companies as an
addition to smart grid and are proved to be helpful in smoothing load curves

grid: misinformation in SNs may cause smart grid users to alter their demand,
resulting in transmission line overloading and in turn leading to catastrophic
impact to the grid. In this paper, we discuss the interdependency in the social
network coupled smart grid and focus on its vulnerability. That is, how much
can the smart grid be damaged when misinformation related to it diffuses in
SNs? To analytically study the problem, we propose the Misinformation Attack
Problem in Social-Smart Grid (MAPSS) that identifies the top critical nodes in
the SN, such that the smart grid can be greatly damaged when misinformation
propagates from those nodes. This problem is challenging as we have to
incorporate the complexity of the two networks concurrently. Nevertheless, we
propose a technique that can explicitly take into account information diffusion

evaluating node criticality, based on which we propose various strategies in
selecting the most critical nodes. Also, we introduce controlled load shedding

question: Can crowdsourcing be reliably used to assess the truthfulness of
information and to create large-scale labeled collections for information
credibility systems? To address this issue, we present the results of an
extensive study based on crowdsourcing: we collect thousands of truthfulness
assessments over two datasets, and we compare expert judgments with crowd
judgments, expressed on scales with various granularity levels. We also measure
the political bias and the cognitive background of the workers, and quantify
their effect on the reliability of the data provided by the crowd.","['Kevin Roitero', 'Michael Soprano', 'Shaoyang Fan', 'Damiano Spina', 'Stefano Mizzaro', 'Gianluca Demartini']",0,0.6847575
"The year 2020 is experiencing a global health and economic crisis due to the

helping to combat this pandemic, including monitoring of the virus spread,
enabling healthcare automation, and allowing virtual education and

"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has become a home ground for
misinformation. To tackle this infodemic, scientific oversight, as well as a
better understanding by practitioners in crisis management, is needed. We have
conducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content of
misinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain early
insights. We have collected all tweets mentioned in the verdicts of
fact-checked claims related to COVID-19 by over 92 professional fact-checking
organisations between January and mid-July 2020 and share this corpus with the
community. This resulted in 1 500 tweets relating to 1 274 false and 276
partially false claims, respectively. Exploratory analysis of author accounts
revealed that the verified twitter handle(including Organisation/celebrity) are
also involved in either creating (new tweets) or spreading (retweet) the
misinformation. Additionally, we found that false claims propagate faster than
partially false claims. Compare to a background corpus of COVID-19 tweets,
tweets with misinformation are more often concerned with discrediting other
information on social media. Authors use less tentative language and appear to
be more driven by concerns of potential harm to others. Our results enable us
to suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic as well as

misinformation.","['Gautam Kishore Shahi', 'Anne Dirkson', 'Tim A. Majchrzak']",5,0.74573416
"COVID-19 infodemic has been spreading faster than the pandemic itself. The
misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's
health and governance systems. Since social media is the largest source of
information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating of
misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns
resulting from it. During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp
45% increase in the usage of its curated events page, and a 30% increase in its
direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study, we analyze the
psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official
bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look
at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified
the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram
based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related
emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related
emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag
relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official
bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state
bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical
Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker

"Distinguishing between misinformation and real information is one of the most
challenging problems in today's interconnected world. The vast majority of the
state-of-the-art in detecting misinformation is fully supervised, requiring a

time-consuming, and challenging to do so in a way that keeps up with the

scenarios where the number of annotations is limited. In such scenarios, we
investigate how tapping on a diverse number of resources that characterize a

of labels. In particular, our contributions in this paper are twofold: 1) We
propose the use of three different aspects: article content, context of social

"For years, many studies employed sentiment analysis to understand the
reasoning behind people's choices and feelings, their communication styles, and
the communities which they belong to. We argue that gaining more in-depth
insight into moral dimensions coupled with sentiment analysis can potentially
provide superior results. Understanding moral foundations can yield powerful
results in terms of perceiving the intended meaning of the text data, as the
concept of morality provides additional information on the unobservable
characteristics of information processing and non-conscious cognitive
processes. Therefore, we studied latent moral loadings of Syrian White
Helmets-related tweets of Twitter users from April 1st, 2018 to April 30th,
2019. For the operationalization and quantification of moral rhetoric in
tweets, we use Extended Moral Foundations Dictionary in which five
psychological dimensions (Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty,
Authority/Respect and Purity/Sanctity) are considered. We show that people tend
to share more tweets involving the virtue moral rhetoric than the tweets
involving the vice rhetoric. We observe that the pattern of the moral rhetoric
of tweets among these five dimensions are very similar during different time
periods, while the strength of the five dimension is time-variant. Even though
there is no significant difference between the use of Fairness/Reciprocity,
In-group/Loyalty or Purity/Sanctity rhetoric, the less use of Harm/Care
rhetoric is significant and remarkable. Besides, the strength of the moral

paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we
propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing based risk alert systems to
spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer COVID-19 propagation.
CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the
COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas. The CovidSens concept is
motivated by three observations: 1) people actively share their experience of
COVID-19 via online social media, 2) official warning channels and news
agencies are relatively slower than people reporting on social media, and 3)
online users are frequently equipped with powerful mobile devices that can
perform data processing and analytics. We envision unprecedented opportunities
to leverage posts generated by ordinary people to build real-time sensing and
analytic system for gathering and circulating COVID-19 propagation data.
Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to
distill reliable information on COVID-19 with prevailing rumors and
misinformation? How to inform the general public about the state of the spread
timely and effectively? How to leverage the computational power on edge devices
to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms? In this

disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on
all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special
law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day
of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of
interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive
mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and
issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After
introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have
found out that Twitter reflected the structural division of the Polish
political sphere. We were able to identify clear communities of governing
party, mainstream oppostition and protestant group and potential sources of

"Recent years have seen a marked increase in the spread of misinformation, a
phenomenon which has been accelerated and amplified by social media such as
Facebook and Twitter. While some actors spread misinformation to push a
specific agenda, it has also been widely documented that others aim to simply
disrupt the network by increasing disagreement and polarization across the
network and thereby destabilizing society. Popular social networks are also
vulnerable to large-scale attacks. Motivated by this reality, we introduce a
simple model of network disruption where an adversary can take over a limited
number of user profiles in a social network with the aim of maximizing
disagreement and/or polarization in the network.
  We investigate this model both theoretically and empirically. We show that
the adversary will always change the opinion of a taken-over profile to an
extreme in order to maximize disruption. We also prove that an adversary can
increase disagreement / polarization at most linearly in the number of user
profiles it takes over. Furthermore, we present a detailed empirical study of
several natural algorithms for the adversary on both synthetic networks and
real world (Reddit and Twitter) data sets. These show that even simple,
unsophisticated heuristics, such as targeting centrists, can disrupt a network
effectively, causing a large increase in disagreement / polarization. Studying
the problem of network disruption through the lens of an adversary thus

misinformation in shaping the health of nations. The deluge of unverified
information that spreads faster than the epidemic itself is an unprecedented
phenomenon that has put millions of lives in danger. Mitigating this Infodemic
requires strong health messaging systems that are engaging, vernacular,
scalable, effective and continuously learn the new patterns of misinformation.
  Objective: We created WashKaro, a multi-pronged intervention for mitigating
misinformation through conversational AI, machine translation and natural
language processing. WashKaro provides the right information matched against
WHO guidelines through AI, and delivers it in the right format in local
languages.
  Methods: We theorize (i) an NLP based AI engine that could continuously
incorporate user feedback to improve relevance of information, (ii) bite sized
audio in the local language to improve penetrance in a country with skewed
gender literacy ratios, and (iii) conversational but interactive AI engagement
with users towards an increased health awareness in the community. Results: A
total of 5026 people who downloaded the app during the study window, among
those 1545 were active users. Our study shows that 3.4 times more females
engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of
AI-filtered news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning,

"Community-aware centrality is an emerging research area in network science
concerned with the importance of nodes in relation to community structure.
Measures are a function of a network's structure and a given partition.
Previous approaches extend classical centrality measures to account for
community structure with little connection to community detection theory. In
contrast, we propose cluster-quality vitality measures, i.e., modularity
vitality, a community-aware measure which is well-grounded in both centrality
and community detection theory. Modularity vitality quantifies positive and
negative contributions to community structure, which indicate a node's role as
a community bridge or hub. We derive a computationally efficient method of
calculating modularity vitality for all nodes in O(M + NC) time, where C is the
number of communities. We systematically fragment networks by removing central
nodes, and find that modularity vitality consistently outperforms existing
community-aware centrality measures. Modularity vitality is over 8 times more
effective than the next-best method on a million-node infrastructure network.
This result does not generalize to social media communication networks, which
exhibit extreme robustness to all community-aware centrality attacks. This
robustness suggests that user-based interventions to mitigate misinformation

"Artificial neural networks are well-known to be susceptible to catastrophic
forgetting when continually learning from sequences of tasks. Various continual
(or ""incremental"") learning approaches have been proposed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting, but they are typically adversary agnostic, i.e., they do not
consider the possibility of a malicious attack. In this effort, we explore the
vulnerability of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a popular continual
learning algorithm for avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We show that an
intelligent adversary can bypass the EWC's defenses, and instead cause gradual
and deliberate forgetting by introducing small amounts of misinformation to the
model during training. We demonstrate such an adversary's ability to assume
control of the model via injection of ""backdoor"" attack samples on both
permuted and split benchmark variants of the MNIST dataset. Importantly, once
the model has learned the adversarial misinformation, the adversary can then
control the amount of forgetting of any task. Equivalently, the malicious actor
can create a ""false memory"" about any task by inserting carefully-designed
backdoor samples to any fraction of the test instances of that task. Perhaps
most damaging, we show this vulnerability to be very acute; neural network

"Numerous real-world systems, for instance, the communication platforms and
transportation systems, can be abstracted into complex networks. Containing
spreading dynamics (e.g., epidemic transmission and misinformation propagation)
in networked systems is a hot topic in multiple fronts. Most of the previous
strategies are based on the immunization of nodes. However, sometimes, these
node--based strategies can be impractical. For instance, in the train
transportation networks, it is dramatic to isolating train stations for flu
prevention. On the contrary, temporarily suspending some connections between
stations is more acceptable. Thus, we pay attention to the edge-based
containing strategy. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to find
the optimal edge for containing the spreading of the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks. In specific, by
performing a perturbation method to the discrete-Markovian-chain equations of
the SIS model, we derive a formula that approximately provides the decremental
outbreak size after the deactivation of a certain edge in the network. Then, we
determine the optimal edge by simply choosing the one with the largest
decremental outbreak size. Note that our proposed theoretical framework
incorporates the information of both network structure and spreading dynamics.
Finally, we test the performance of our method by extensive numerical
simulations. Results demonstrate that our strategy always outperforms other
strategies based only on structural properties (degree or edge betweenness

spreading models and offers inspirations for further investigations on
edge-based immunization strategies.","['Jiajun Xian', 'Dan Yang', 'Liming Pan', 'Wei Wang']",2,0.82630634

"In the Social Web scenario, large amounts of User-Generated Content (UGC) are
diffused through social media often without almost any form of traditional
trusted intermediaries. Therefore, the risk of running into misinformation is
not negligible. For this reason, assessing and mining the credibility of online
information constitutes nowadays a fundamental research issue. Credibility,
also referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are
not always able to discern, with their own cognitive capacities, genuine
information from fake one. Hence, in the last years, several approaches have
been proposed to automatically assess credibility in social media. Many of them
are based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine learning techniques
to identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are
emerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility

"Over the past few years, we have observed different media outlets' attempts

misinformation to viral proportions. Understanding the spread of misinformation
from account-level perspective is thus a pressing problem. In this work, we aim
to present a feature-driven approach to detect PSM accounts in social media.
Inspired by the literature, we set out to assess PSMs from three broad
perspectives: (1) user-related information (e.g., user activity, profile
characteristics), (2) source-related information (i.e., information linked via
URLs shared by users) and (3) content-related information (e.g., tweets
characteristics). For the user-related information, we investigate malicious
signals using causality analysis (i.e., if user is frequently a cause of viral
cascades) and profile characteristics (e.g., number of followers, etc.). For
the source-related information, we explore various malicious properties linked
to URLs (e.g., URL address, content of the associated website, etc.). Finally,
for the content-related information, we examine attributes (e.g., number of

"As robots become more prevalent, the importance of the field of human-robot
interaction (HRI) grows accordingly. As such, we should endeavor to employ the
best statistical practices. Likert scales are commonly used metrics in HRI to
measure perceptions and attitudes. Due to misinformation or honest mistakes,
most HRI researchers do not adopt best practices when analyzing Likert data. We
conduct a review of psychometric literature to determine the current standard
for Likert scale design and analysis. Next, we conduct a survey of four years
of the International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (2016 through 2019)
and report on incorrect statistical practices and design of Likert scales.
During these years, only 3 of the 110 papers applied proper statistical testing

meaningful improvement in the design and testing of Likert scales. Lastly, we

"In recent years, disinformation including fake news, has became a global
phenomenon due to its explosive growth, particularly on social media. The wide
spread of disinformation and fake news can cause detrimental societal effects.
Despite the recent progress in detecting disinformation and fake news, it is
still non-trivial due to its complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and costs
of fact-checking or annotation. The goal of this chapter is to pave the way for
appreciating the challenges and advancements via: (1) introducing the types of
information disorder on social media and examine their differences and
connections; (2) describing important and emerging tasks to combat
disinformation for characterization, detection and attribution; and (3)
discussing a weak supervision approach to detect disinformation with limited
labeled data. We then provide an overview of the chapters in this book that
represent the recent advancements in three related parts: (1) user engagements
in the dissemination of information disorder; (2) techniques on detecting and
mitigating disinformation; and (3) trending issues such as ethics, blockchain,
clickbaits, etc. We hope this book to be a convenient entry point for
researchers, practitioners, and students to understand the problems and
challenges, learn state-of-the-art solutions for their specific needs, and
quickly identify new research problems in their domains.","['Kai Shu', 'Suhang Wang', 'Dongwon Lee', 'Huan Liu']",0,0.82645905
"Background. In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key
immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels. In 2017, the
Italian Gov't expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing
penalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general
elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the
Gov't in charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new
Gov't established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties. Objectives and
Methods. Using a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018, we
aimed to: (i) characterize the temporal flow of vaccines communication on
Twitter (ii) evaluate the polarity of vaccination opinions and usefulness of
Twitter data to estimate vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigate whether
the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have
originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results. Vaccine-relevant
tweeters interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of
retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.5% unfavourable,
and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity
proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion,
enhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't
suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The
reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical immunization
topics, should never be used for political consensus. This is especially true
given the increasing role of online social media as information source, which
might yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is
worsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts
to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.","['Samantha Ajovalasit', 'Veronica Dorgali', 'Angelo Mazza', ""Alberto D'Onofrio"", 'Piero Manfredi']",12,0.82775617
"Patients increasingly turn to search engines and online content before, or in
place of, talking with a health professional. Low quality health information,
which is common on the internet, presents risks to the patient in the form of
misinformation and a possibly poorer relationship with their physician. To
address this, the DISCERN criteria (developed at University of Oxford) are used
to evaluate the quality of online health information. However, patients are
unlikely to take the time to apply these criteria to the health websites they
visit. We built an automated implementation of the DISCERN instrument (Brief
version) using machine learning models. We compared the performance of a
traditional model (Random Forest) with that of a hierarchical encoder
attention-based neural network (HEA) model using two language embeddings, BERT
and BioBERT. The HEA BERT and BioBERT models achieved average F1-macro scores
across all criteria of 0.75 and 0.74, respectively, outperforming the Random
Forest model (average F1-macro = 0.69). Overall, the neural network based
models achieved 81% and 86% average accuracy at 100% and 80% coverage,
respectively, compared to 94% manual rating accuracy. The attention mechanism
implemented in the HEA architectures not only provided 'model explainability'
by identifying reasonable supporting sentences for the documents fulfilling the
Brief DISCERN criteria, but also boosted F1 performance by 0.05 compared to the
same architecture without an attention mechanism. Our research suggests that it
is feasible to automate online health information quality assessment, which is
an important step towards empowering patients to become informed partners in
the healthcare process.","['Laura Kinkead', 'Ahmed Allam', 'Michael Krauthammer']",1,0.5490572

harvesting and visualization utilizing the tools and analytical features of
NodeXL applied to a degree asymmetric vertex graph set. We consider twitter
graphs harvested for topics related to suicidal ideation, suicide attempts,
self-harm and bullycide. While the twitter-sphere only captures a small and age
biased sample of communications it is a readily available public database for a
wealth of rich topics yielding a large sample set. All these topics gave rise
to highly asymmetric vertex degree graphs and all shared the same general

heavily on the information shared therein to form opinions and make decisions.

"The reported work points at developing a practical approach for power
transmission planners to secure power networks from potential deliberate
attacks. We study the interaction between a system planner (defender) and a
rational attacker who threatens the operation of the power grid. In addition to
the commonly used hardening strategy for protecting the network, a new sort of
resource is introduced under the deception concept. Feint and deception are
acknowledged as effective tools for misleading the attacker in strategic
planning. To this end, the defender deception is mathematically formulated by
releasing misinformation about his plan in the shared cognition-based model. To
reduce the risk of damage in case of deception failure, preemptive-goal
programming is utilized to prioritize the hardening strategy for the vital
components. Furthermore, the value of posturing is introduced which is the
benefits that the deception brings to the system. The problems are formulated
as tri-level mixed-integer linear programming and solved by the
constraint-and-column generation method. Comprehensive simulation studies
performed on WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems indicate how the defender will
save significant cost from protecting his network with posturing rather than
hardening and the proposed approach is a promising development to ensure the
secure operation of power networks.","['Hamzeh Davarikia', 'Masoud Barati', 'Mustafa Al-Assad', 'Yupo Chan']",2,0.6794135
"Allowing machines to choose whether to kill humans would be devastating for
world peace and security. But how do we equip machines with the ability to
learn ethical or even moral choices? Jentzsch et al.(2019) showed that applying
machine learning to human texts can extract deontological ethical reasoning
about ""right"" and ""wrong"" conduct by calculating a moral bias score on a
sentence level using sentence embeddings. The machine learned that it is
objectionable to kill living beings, but it is fine to kill time; It is
essential to eat, yet one might not eat dirt; it is important to spread
information, yet one should not spread misinformation. However, the evaluated
moral bias was restricted to simple actions -- one verb -- and a ranking of
actions with surrounding context. Recently BERT ---and variants such as RoBERTa
and SBERT--- has set a new state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP
tasks. But has BERT also a better moral compass? In this paper, we discuss and
show that this is indeed the case. Thus, recent improvements of language
representations also improve the representation of the underlying ethical and
moral values of the machine. We argue that through an advanced semantic
representation of text, BERT allows one to get better insights of moral and
ethical values implicitly represented in text. This enables the Moral Choice

"Online social networks provide a convenient platform for the spread of
rumors, which could lead to serious aftermaths such as economic losses and
public panic. The classical rumor blocking problem aims to launch a set of
nodes as a positive cascade to compete with misinformation in order to limit
the spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on
one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there are more than one feature
associated with an object. The user's impression on this object is determined
not just by one feature but by his/her overall evaluation on all of these
features. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the
spread of multiple features. Based on that, we propose a Multi-Feature
diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper, and a novel problem, Multi-Feature
Rumor Blocking (MFRB), is formulated on a multi-layer network structure
according to this model. To solve MFRB, we design a creative sampling method,
called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to a multi-layer network structure.
Inspired by martingale analysis, the Revised-IMM algorithm is proposed, and
returns a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our
proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, and show the
effectiveness and accuracy of the Revised-IMM algorithm and significantly

"Thanks to the fast progress in synthetic media generation, creating realistic
false images has become very easy. Such images can be used to wrap ""rich"" fake
news with enhanced credibility, spawning a new wave of high-impact, high-risk
misinformation campaigns. Therefore, there is a fast-growing interest in
reliable detectors of manipulated media. The most powerful detectors, to date,
rely on the subtle traces left by any device on all images acquired by it. In
particular, due to proprietary in-camera processes, like demosaicing or
compression, each camera model leaves trademark traces that can be exploited
for forensic analyses. The absence or distortion of such traces in the target
image is a strong hint of manipulation. In this paper, we challenge such
detectors to gain better insight into their vulnerabilities. This is an
important study in order to build better forgery detectors able to face
malicious attacks. Our proposal consists of a GAN-based approach that injects
camera traces into synthetic images. Given a GAN-generated image, we insert the
traces of a specific camera model into it and deceive state-of-the-art
detectors into believing the image was acquired by that model. Likewise, we
deceive independent detectors of synthetic GAN images into believing the image
is real. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in a wide
array of conditions. Moreover, no prior information on the attacked detectors

"With the prevalence of misinformation online, researchers have focused on
developing various machine learning algorithms to detect fake news. However,
users' perception of machine learning outcomes and related behaviors have been
widely ignored. Hence, this paper proposed to bridge this gap by studying how
to pass the detection results of machine learning to the users, and aid their
decisions in handling misinformation. An online experiment was conducted, to
evaluate the effect of the proposed machine learning warning sign against a
control condition. We examined participants' detection and sharing of news. The
data showed that warning sign's effects on participants' trust toward the fake
news were not significant. However, we found that people's uncertainty about
the authenticity of the news dropped with the presence of the machine learning
warning sign. We also found that social media experience had effects on users'
trust toward the fake news, and age and social media experience had effects on
users' sharing decision. Therefore, the results indicate that there are many
factors worth studying that affect people's trust in the news. Moreover, the
warning sign in communicating machine learning detection results is different
from ordinary warnings and needs more detailed research and design. These
findings hold important implications for the design of machine learning

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to model stealing attacks, which
allows a data-limited adversary with no knowledge of the training dataset to
clone the functionality of a target model, just by using black-box query
access. Such attacks are typically carried out by querying the target model
using inputs that are synthetically generated or sampled from a surrogate
dataset to construct a labeled dataset. The adversary can use this labeled
dataset to train a clone model, which achieves a classification accuracy
comparable to that of the target model. We propose ""Adaptive Misinformation"" to
defend against such model stealing attacks. We identify that all existing model
stealing attacks invariably query the target model with Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) inputs. By selectively sending incorrect predictions for OOD queries, our
defense substantially degrades the accuracy of the attacker's clone model (by
up to 40%), while minimally impacting the accuracy (<0.5%) for benign users.

"Research in combating misinformation reports many negative results: facts may
not change minds, especially if they come from sources that are not trusted.
Individuals can disregard and justify lies told by trusted sources. This
problem is made even worse by social recommendation algorithms which help
amplify conspiracy theories and information confirming one's own biases due to
companies' efforts to optimize for clicks and watch time over individuals' own
values and public good. As a result, more nuanced voices and facts are drowned
out by a continuous erosion of trust in better information sources. Most
misinformation mitigation techniques assume that discrediting, filtering, or
demoting low veracity information will help news consumers make better
information decisions. However, these negative results indicate that some news
consumers, particularly extreme or conspiracy news consumers will not be
helped.
  We argue that, given this background, technology solutions to combating

instead use more subtle nudges towards better information consumption. Repeated
exposure to such nudges can help promote trust in better information sources

been a notorious struggle for social media platforms. Further to the efforts of

usually humorous and carry some political or social message. We hypothesize
that these nuances could be identified using semantic and linguistic cues.
Consequently, we train a machine learning method using semantic representation,
with a state-of-the-art contextual language model, and with linguistic features
based on textual coherence metrics. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits
of our approach compared to the language-based baseline and sheds light on the

"Contagion, broadly construed, refers to anything that can spread infectiously
from peer to peer. Examples include communicable diseases, rumors,
misinformation, ideas, innovations, bank failures, and electrical blackouts.
Sometimes, as in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, a contagion mutates at some
point as it spreads through a network. Here, using a simple
susceptible-infected (SI) model of contagion, we explore the downstream impact
of a single mutation event. Assuming that this mutation occurs at a random node
in the contact network, we calculate the distribution of the number of
""descendants,"" $d$, downstream from the initial ""Patient Zero"" mutant. We find
that the tail of the distribution decays as $d^{-2}$ for complete graphs,
random graphs, small-world networks, networks with block-like structure, and
other infinite-dimensional networks. This prediction agrees with the observed
statistics of memes propagating and mutating on Facebook, and is expected to
hold for other effectively infinite-dimensional networks, such as the global
human contact network. In a wider context, our approach suggests a possible
starting point for a mesoscopic theory of contagion. Such a theory would focus
on the paths traced by a spreading contagion, thereby furnishing an
intermediate level of description between that of individual nodes and the
total infected population. We anticipate that contagion pathways will hold
valuable lessons, given their role as the conduits through which single
mutations, innovations, or failures can sweep through a network as a whole.","['Jonas S. Juul', 'Steven H. Strogatz']",2,0.71874917

achieved unprecedented success in image synthesis. They are widely adopted in
synthesizing facial images which brings potential security concerns to humans
as the fakes spread and fuel the misinformation. However, robust detectors of
these AI-synthesized fake faces are still in their infancy and are not ready to
fully tackle this emerging challenge. In this work, we propose a novel
approach, named FakeSpotter, based on monitoring neuron behaviors to spot
AI-synthesized fake faces. The studies on neuron coverage and interactions have
successfully shown that they can be served as testing criteria for deep
learning systems, especially under the settings of being exposed to adversarial
attacks. Here, we conjecture that monitoring neuron behavior can also serve as
an asset in detecting fake faces since layer-by-layer neuron activation
patterns may capture more subtle features that are important for the fake
detector. Experimental results on detecting four types of fake faces
synthesized with the state-of-the-art GANs and evading four perturbation
attacks show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.","['Run Wang', 'Felix Juefei-Xu', 'Lei Ma', 'Xiaofei Xie', 'Yihao Huang', 'Jian Wang', 'Yang Liu']",7,0.76085675

"Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the online sharing of
medical information, with videos representing a large fraction of such online
sources. Previous studies have however shown that more than half of the
health-related videos on platforms such as YouTube contain misleading
information and biases. Hence, it is crucial to build computational tools that
can help evaluate the quality of these videos so that users can obtain accurate
information to help inform their decisions. In this study, we focus on the
automatic detection of misinformation in YouTube videos. We select prostate
cancer videos as our entry point to tackle this problem. The contribution of
this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 250
videos related to prostate cancer manually annotated for misinformation.
Second, we explore the use of linguistic, acoustic, and user engagement
features for the development of classification models to identify

"The numerous expanding online social networks offer fast channels for
misinformation spreading, which could have a serious impact on socioeconomic
systems. Researchers across multiple areas have paid attention to this issue
with a view of addressing it. However, no systematical theoretical study has
been performed to date on observing misinformation spreading on correlated
multiplex networks. In this study, we propose a multiplex network-based
misinformation spreading model, considering the fact that each individual can
obtain misinformation from multiple platforms. Subsequently, we develop a
heterogeneous edge-base compartmental theory to comprehend the spreading
dynamics of our proposed model. In addition, we establish an analytical method
based on stability analysis to obtain the misinformation outbreak threshold. On
the basis of these theories, we finally analyze the influence of different
dynamical and structural parameters on the misinformation spreading dynamics.
Results show that the misinformation outbreak size $R(\infty)$ grows
continuously with the effective transmission probability $\beta$ once $\beta$
exceeds a certain value, that is, the outbreak threshold $\beta_c$. A large
average degrees, strong degree heterogeneity, or positive inter-layer
correlation will reduce $\beta_c$, accelerating the outbreak of misinformation.
Besides, increasing the degree heterogeneity or a more positive inter-layer
correlation will both enlarge (reduce) $R(\infty)$ for small (large) values of
$\beta$. Our systematic theoretical analysis results agree well with the
numerical simulation results. Our proposed model and accurate theoretical
analysis will serve as a useful framework to understand and predict the
spreading dynamics of misinformation on multiplex networks, and thereby pave
the way to address this serious issue.","['Jiajun Xian', 'Dan Yang', 'Liming Pan', 'Wei Wang', 'Zhen Wang']",2,0.7881396
"Recent developments in neural language models (LMs) have raised concerns
about their potential misuse for automatically spreading misinformation. In
light of these concerns, several studies have proposed to detect
machine-generated fake news by capturing their stylistic differences from
human-written text. These approaches, broadly termed stylometry, have found
success in source attribution and misinformation detection in human-written
texts. However, in this work, we show that stylometry is limited against
machine-generated misinformation. While humans speak differently when trying to
deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying
motive. Thus, though stylometry can successfully prevent impersonation by
identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications
from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks
demonstrating the stylistic similarity between malicious and legitimate uses of
LMs, employed in auto-completion and editing-assistance settings. Our findings
highlight the need for non-stylometry approaches in detecting machine-generated
misinformation, and open up the discussion on the desired evaluation

"Competitive information diffusion on large-scale social networks reveals
fundamental characteristics of rumor contagions and has profound influence on
public opinion formation. There has been growing interest in exploring
dynamical mechanisms of the competing evolutions recently. Nevertheless, the
impacts of population homophily, which determines powerful collective human
behaviors, remains unclear. In this paper, we incorporate homophily effects
into a modified competitive ignorant-spreader-ignorant (SIS) rumor diffusion
model with generalized population preference. Using microscopic Markov chain
approach, we first derive the phase diagram of competing diffusion results and
examine how competitive information spreads and evolves on social networks. We
then explore the detailed effects of homophily, which is modeled by a rewiring
mechanism. Results show that homophily promotes the formation of divided ""echo
chambers"" and protects the disadvantaged information from extinction, which
further changes or even reverses the evolutionary advantage, i.e., the
difference of final proportions of the competitive information. We highlight
the conclusion that the reversals may happen only when the initially
disadvantaged information has stronger transmission ability, owning diffusion
advantage over the other one. Our framework provides profound insight into
competing dynamics with population homophily, which may pave ways for further
controlling misinformation and guiding public belief systems. Moreover, the
reversing condition sheds light on designing effective competing strategies in
many real scenarios.","['Longzhao Liu', 'Xin Wang', 'Yi Zheng', 'Wenyi Fang', 'Shaoting Tang', 'Zhiming Zheng']",2,0.6316837
"The buzz over the so-called ""fake news"" has created concerns about a
degenerated media environment and led to the need for technological solutions.
As the detection of fake news is increasingly considered a technological
problem, it has attracted considerable research. Most of these studies
primarily focus on utilizing information extracted from textual news content.
In contrast, we focus on detecting fake news solely based on structural
information of social networks. We suggest that the underlying network
connections of users that share fake news are discriminative enough to support
the detection of fake news. Thereupon, we model each post as a network of
friendship interactions and represent a collection of posts as a
multidimensional tensor. Taking into account the available labeled data, we
propose a tensor factorization method which associates the class labels of data
samples with their latent representations. Specifically, we combine a
classification error term with the standard factorization in a unified
optimization process. Results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method is competitive against state-of-the-art methods by implementing
an arguably simpler approach.","['Frosso Papanastasiou', 'Georgios Katsimpras', 'Georgios Paliouras']",4,0.8415731

"In two-player zero-sum stochastic games, where two competing players make
decisions under uncertainty, a pair of optimal strategies is traditionally
described by Nash equilibrium and computed under the assumption that the
players have perfect information about the stochastic transition model of the

vulnerable to unforeseen changes in the environment. In this paper, we
introduce entropy-regularized stochastic games where each player aims to
maximize the causal entropy of its strategy in addition to its expected payoff.
The regularization term balances each player's rationality with its belief
about the level of misinformation about the transition model. We consider both
entropy-regularized $N$-stage and entropy-regularized discounted stochastic
games, and establish the existence of a value in both games. Moreover, we prove
the sufficiency of Markovian and stationary mixed strategies to attain the
value, respectively, in $N$-stage and discounted games. Finally, we present
algorithms, which are based on convex optimization problems, to compute the
optimal strategies. In a numerical example, we demonstrate the proposed method

"This White Paper is a call to action for astronomers to respond to climate
change with a large structural transition within our profession. Many
astronomers are deeply concerned about climate change and act upon it in their
personal and professional lives, and many organizations within astronomy have
incorporated incremental changes. We need a collective impact model to better
network and grow our efforts so that we can achieve results that are on the
scale appropriate to address climate change at the necessary level indicated by
scientific research; e.g., becoming carbon neutral by 2050. We need to
implement strategies within two primary drivers of our field: (1) Education and
Outreach, and (2) Research Practices and Infrastructure. (1) In the classroom
and through public talks, astronomers reach a large audience. Astronomy is
closely connected to the science of climate change, and it is arguably the most
important topic we include in our curriculum. Due to misinformation and
disinformation, climate change communication is different than for other areas
of science. We therefore need to expand our communication and implement
effective strategies, for which there is now a considerable body of research.
(2) On a per-person basis astronomers have an outsized carbon impact. There are
numerous ways we can reduce our footprint; e.g., in the design and operation of
telescope facilities and in the optimization and reduction of travel.
Fortunately, many of these solutions are win-win scenarios, e.g., increasing
the online presence of conferences will reduce the carbon footprint while
increasing participation, especially for astronomers working with fewer
financial resources. Astronomers have an obligation to act on climate change in
every way possible, and we need to do it now. In this White Paper, we outline a

"Beliefs are not facts, but they are factive - they feel like facts. This
property is what can make misinformation dangerous. Being able to deliberately
navigate through a landscape of often conflicting factive statements is
difficult when there is no way to show the relationships between them without
incorporating the information in linear, narrative forms. In this paper, we
present a mechanism to produce maps of belief places, where populations agree
on salient features of fictional environments, and belief spaces, where
subgroups have related but distinct perspectives. Using a model developed using
agent-based simulation, we show that by observing the repeated behaviors of
human participants in the same social context, it is possible to build maps
that show the shared narrative environment overlaid with traces that show
unique, individual or subgroup perspectives. Our contribution is a
proof-of-concept system, based on the affordances of fantasy tabletop
role-playing games, which support multiple groups interacting with the same

the network structure, we establish that each agent learns the truth
asymptotically almost surely. As our main contribution, we prove that with
probability 1, each false hypothesis is ruled out by every agent exponentially
fast at a network-independent rate that is strictly larger than existing rates.
We then develop a computationally-efficient variant of our learning rule that
is provably resilient to agents who do not behave as expected (as represented

"Echo chambers and opinion polarization recently quantified in several

of radicalization, as a reinforcing mechanism driving the evolution to extreme
opinions from moderate initial conditions. Inspired by empirical findings on

"Ranking models are typically designed to provide rankings that optimize some
measure of immediate utility to the users. As a result, they have been unable
to anticipate an increasing number of undesirable long-term consequences of
their proposed rankings, from fueling the spread of misinformation and
increasing polarization to degrading social discourse. Can we design ranking
models that understand the consequences of their proposed rankings and, more
importantly, are able to avoid the undesirable ones? In this paper, we first
introduce a joint representation of rankings and user dynamics using Markov
decision processes. Then, we show that this representation greatly simplifies
the construction of consequential ranking models that trade off the immediate
utility and the long-term welfare. In particular, we can obtain optimal
consequential rankings just by applying weighted sampling on the rankings
provided by models that maximize measures of immediate utility. However, in
practice, such a strategy may be inefficient and impractical, specially in high
dimensional scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce an efficient

"Background:
  Tools used to appraise the credibility of health information are
time-consuming to apply and require context-specific expertise, limiting their
use for quickly identifying and mitigating the spread of misinformation as it
emerges. Our aim was to estimate the proportion of vaccination-related posts on
Twitter are likely to be misinformation, and how unevenly exposure to
misinformation was distributed among Twitter users.
  Methods:
  Sampling from 144,878 vaccination-related web pages shared on Twitter between
January 2017 and March 2018, we used a seven-point checklist adapted from two
validated tools to appraise the credibility of a small subset of 474. These
were used to train several classifiers (random forest, support vector machines,
and a recurrent neural network with transfer learning), using the text from a
web page to predict whether the information satisfies each of the seven
criteria.
  Results:
  Applying the best performing classifier to the 144,878 web pages, we found
that 14.4% of relevant posts to text-based communications were linked to
webpages of low credibility and made up 9.2% of all potential
vaccination-related exposures. However, the 100 most popular links to
misinformation were potentially seen by between 2 million and 80 million
Twitter users, and for a substantial sub-population of Twitter users engaging
with vaccination-related information, links to misinformation appear to
dominate the vaccination-related information to which they were exposed.
  Conclusions:
  We proposed a new method for automatically appraising the credibility of
webpages based on a combination of validated checklist tools. The results
suggest that an automatic credibility appraisal tool can be used to find
populations at higher risk of exposure to misinformation or applied proactively
to add friction to the sharing of low credibility vaccination information.","['Zubair Shah', 'Didi Surian', 'Amalie Dyda', 'Enrico Coiera', 'Kenneth D. Mandl', 'Adam G. Dunn']",12,0.7499998
"The prevalence of new technologies and social media has amplified the effects
of misinformation on our societies. Thus, it is necessary to create
computational tools to mitigate their effects effectively. This study aims to
provide a critical overview of computational approaches concerned with
combating misinformation. To this aim, I offer an overview of scholarly
definitions of misinformation. I adopt a framework for studying misinformation
that suggests paying attention to the source, content, and consumers as the
three main elements involved in the process of misinformation and I provide an
overview of literature from disciplines of psychology, media studies, and
cognitive sciences that deal with each of these elements. Using the framework,
I overview the existing computational methods that deal with 1) misinformation
detection and fact-checking using Content 2) Identifying untrustworthy Sources
and social bots, and 3) Consumer-facing tools and methods aiming to make humans
resilient to misinformation. I find that the vast majority of works in computer
science and information technology is concerned with the crucial tasks of
detection and verification of content and sources of misinformation. Moreover,
I find that computational research focusing on Consumers of Misinformation in
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related fields are very sparse and often
do not deal with the subtleties of this process. The majority of existing
interfaces and systems are less concerned with the usability of the tools
rather than the robustness and accuracy of the detection methods. Using this
survey, I call for an interdisciplinary approach towards human-misinformation
interaction that focuses on building methods and tools that robustly deal with
such complex psychological/social phenomena.",['Alireza Karduni'],0,0.82528675
"The prevalence of misinformation on online social media has tangible
empirical connections to increasing political polarization and partisan
antipathy in the United States. Ranking algorithms for social recommendation
often encode broad assumptions about network structure (like homophily) and
group cognition (like, social action is largely imitative). Assumptions like
these can be na\""ive and exclusionary in the era of fake news and ideological
uniformity towards the political poles. We examine these assumptions with aid
from the user-centric framework of trustworthiness in social recommendation.

"Recent years have witnessed a surge of manipulation of public opinion and
political events by malicious social media actors. These users are referred to
as ""Pathogenic Social Media (PSM)"" accounts. PSMs are key users in spreading
misinformation in social media to viral proportions. These accounts can be
either controlled by real users or automated bots. Identification of PSMs is
thus of utmost importance for social media authorities. The burden usually
falls to automatic approaches that can identify these accounts and protect
social media reputation. However, lack of sufficient labeled examples for
devising and training sophisticated approaches to combat these accounts is
still one of the foremost challenges facing social media firms. In contrast,
unlabeled data is abundant and cheap to obtain thanks to massive user-generated
data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised causal inference PSM
detection framework, SemiPsm, to compensate for the lack of labeled data. In
particular, the proposed method leverages unlabeled data in the form of
manifold regularization and only relies on cascade information. This is in
contrast to the existing approaches that use exhaustive feature engineering
(e.g., profile information, network structure, etc.). Evidence from empirical
experiments on a real-world ISIS-related dataset from Twitter suggests
promising results of utilizing unlabeled instances for detecting PSMs.","['Hamidreza Alvari', 'Elham Shaabani', 'Soumajyoti Sarkar', 'Ghazaleh Beigi', 'Paulo Shakarian']",13,0.6764927

"Information diffusion is usually modeled as a process in which immutable
pieces of information propagate over a network. In reality, however, messages
are not immutable, but may be morphed with every step, potentially entailing
large cumulative distortions. This process may lead to misinformation even in
the absence of malevolent actors, and understanding it is crucial for modeling
and improving online information systems. Here, we perform a controlled,
crowdsourced experiment in which we simulate the propagation of information
from medical research papers. Starting from the original abstracts, crowd
workers iteratively shorten previously produced summaries to increasingly
smaller lengths. We also collect control summaries where the original abstract
is compressed directly to the final target length. Comparing cascades to
controls allows us to separate the effect of the length constraint from that of
accumulated distortion. Via careful manual coding, we annotate lexical and
semantic units in the medical abstracts and track them along cascades. We find
that iterative summarization has a negative impact due to the accumulation of
error, but that high-quality intermediate summaries result in less distorted
messages than in the control case. Different types of information behave
differently; in particular, the conclusion of a medical abstract (i.e., its key
message) is distorted most. Finally, we compare abstractive with extractive
summaries, finding that the latter are less prone to semantic distortion.
Overall, this work is a first step in studying information cascades without the
assumption that disseminated content is immutable, with implications on our

This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct
classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news
sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate
analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click
on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of

"In recent years, the phenomenon of online misinformation and junk news
circulating on social media has come to constitute an important and widespread
problem affecting public life online across the globe, particularly around
important political events such as elections. At the same time, there have been
calls for more transparency around misinformation on social media platforms, as
many of the most popular social media platforms function as ""walled gardens,""
where it is impossible for researchers and the public to readily examine the
scale and nature of misinformation activity as it unfolds on the platforms. In
order to help address this, we present the Junk News Aggregator, a publicly
available interactive web tool, which allows anyone to examine, in near
real-time, all of the public content posted to Facebook by important junk news
sources in the US. It allows the public to gain access to and examine the
latest articles posted on Facebook (the most popular social media platform in
the US and one where content is not readily accessible at scale from the open
Web), as well as organise them by time, news publisher, and keywords of
interest, and sort them based on all eight engagement metrics available on
Facebook. Therefore, the Aggregator allows the public to gain insights on the
volume, content, key themes, and types and volumes of engagement received by
content posted by junk news publishers, in near real-time, hence opening up and
offering transparency in these activities as they unfold, at scale across the
top most popular junk news publishers. In this way, the Aggregator can help

"Online misinformation has been considered as one of the top global risks as
it may cause serious consequences such as economic damages and public panic.
The misinformation prevention problem aims at generating a positive cascade

this paper, we study the misinformation prevention problem under the prominent
independent cascade model. Due to the #P-hardness in computing influence, the
core problem is to design effective sampling methods to estimate the function
value. The main contribution of this paper is a novel sampling method.
Different from the classic reverse sampling technique which treats all nodes
equally and samples the node uniformly, the proposed method proceeds with a
hybrid sampling process which is able to attach high weights to the users who
are prone to be affected by the misinformation. Consequently, the new sampling
method is more powerful in generating effective samples used for computing seed
nodes for the positive cascade. Based on the new hybrid sample technique, we
design an algorithm offering a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation. We

"Echo chambers in online social networks, in which users prefer to interact
only with ideologically-aligned peers, are believed to facilitate
misinformation spreading and contribute to radicalize political discourse. In
this paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading
phenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter
messages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related
to the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define
a continuous {political position} parameter, independent of the network's
structure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the
strongly connected component of the network, reflected in two well-separated
communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By
means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in
propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreadability,
strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment sentiments
are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than
users expressing anti-impeachment sentiments. Furthermore, the users'
spreadability is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position,
of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence
of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light

"Recently, online social networks have become major battlegrounds for
political campaigns, viral marketing, and the dissemination of news. As a
consequence, ''bad actors'' are increasingly exploiting these platforms,
becoming a key challenge for their administrators, businesses and the society

social networks by these actors. While some have advocated for stricter
policies to control the spread of misinformation in social networks, this often
happens in detriment of their democratic and organic structure. In this paper
we study how to limit the influence of a target set of users in a network via
the removal of a few edges. The idea is to control the diffusion processes
while minimizing the amount of disturbance in the network structure.
  We formulate the influence limitation problem in a data-driven fashion, by
taking into account past propagation traces. Moreover, we consider two types of
constraints over the set of edge removals, a budget constraint and also a, more
general, set of matroid constraints. These problems lead to interesting
challenges in terms of algorithm design. For instance, we are able to show that
influence limitation is APX-hard and propose deterministic and probabilistic
approximation algorithms for the budgeted and matroid version of the problem,

"The online social networks facilitate naturally for the users to share
information. On these platforms, each user shares information based on his or

it takes too much time to validate the news. Therefore, a robust and new system
is required to check the information authenticity within the network, to stop

blockchain model, a chain is created by combining blocks of information. Each
node of network propagates the information based on its credibility to its peer

a connected system consisting of three homogeneous neural semantic matching
models that conduct document retrieval, sentence selection, and claim
verification jointly for fact extraction and verification. For evidence
retrieval (document retrieval and sentence selection), unlike traditional
vector space IR models in which queries and sources are matched in some
pre-designed term vector space, we develop neural models to perform deep
semantic matching from raw textual input, assuming no intermediate term
representation and no access to structured external knowledge bases. We also
show that Pageview frequency can also help improve the performance of evidence
retrieval results, that later can be matched by using our neural semantic
matching network. For claim verification, unlike previous approaches that
simply feed upstream retrieved evidence and the claim to a natural language
inference (NLI) model, we further enhance the NLI model by providing it with
internal semantic relatedness scores (hence integrating it with the evidence
retrieval modules) and ontological WordNet features. Experiments on the FEVER
dataset indicate that (1) our neural semantic matching method outperforms
popular TF-IDF and encoder models, by significant margins on all evidence
retrieval metrics, (2) the additional relatedness score and WordNet features

Challenges identified include lack of resources, technologies, and political

"Fake news are nowadays an issue of pressing concern, given their recent rise
as a potential threat to high-quality journalism and well-informed public
discourse. The Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) was organized in 2017 to encourage
the development of machine learning-based classification systems for stance
detection (i.e., for identifying whether a particular news article agrees,
disagrees, discusses, or is unrelated to a particular news headline), thus
helping in the detection and analysis of possible instances of fake news. This
article presents a new approach to tackle this stance detection problem, based
on the combination of string similarity features with a deep neural
architecture that leverages ideas previously advanced in the context of
learning efficient text representations, document classification, and natural
language inference. Specifically, we use bi-directional Recurrent Neural
Networks, together with max-pooling over the temporal/sequential dimension and
neural attention, for representing (i) the headline, (ii) the first two
sentences of the news article, and (iii) the entire news article. These
representations are then combined/compared, complemented with similarity
features inspired on other FNC-1 approaches, and passed to a final layer that
predicts the stance of the article towards the headline. We also explore the
use of external sources of information, specifically large datasets of sentence
pairs originally proposed for training and evaluating natural language
inference methods, in order to pre-train specific components of the neural
network architecture (e.g., the RNNs used for encoding sentences). The obtained
results attest to the effectiveness of the proposed ideas and show that our
model, particularly when considering pre-training and the combination of neural
representations together with similarity features, slightly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art.","['Luís Borges', 'Bruno Martins', 'Pável Calado']",4,0.72823554
"Ranking algorithms are the information gatekeepers of the Internet era. We
develop a stylized model to study the effects of ranking algorithms on opinion
dynamics. We consider a search engine that uses an algorithm based on
popularity and on personalization. We find that popularity-based rankings
generate an advantage of the fewer effect: fewer websites reporting a given
signal attract relatively more traffic overall. This highlights a novel,
ranking-driven channel that explains the diffusion of misinformation, as
websites reporting incorrect information may attract an amplified amount of
traffic precisely because they are few. Furthermore, when individuals provide
sufficiently positive feedback to the ranking algorithm, popularity-based
rankings tend to aggregate information while personalization acts in the
opposite direction.","['Fabrizio Germano', 'Francesco Sobbrio']",3,0.54167086

economic damages. The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the
spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing
campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of
the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of
cascades are allowed. This paper makes four contributions. First, we provide a
formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept
called as cascade priority. Second, we show that the misinformation containment
problem cannot be approximated within a factor of
$\Omega(2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}n^4})$ in polynomial time unless $NP \subseteq
DTIME(n^{\polylog{n}})$. Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority
that are frequently seen in real social networks. Finally, we design novel
algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem. The
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging
experimental results.","['Guangmo Tong', 'Weili Wu', 'Ding-Zhu Du']",2,0.735448
"Misinformation such as fake news is one of the big challenges of our society.
Research on automated fact-checking has proposed methods based on supervised
learning, but these approaches do not consider external evidence apart from
labeled training instances. Recent approaches counter this deficit by
considering external sources related to a claim. However, these methods require
substantial feature modeling and rich lexicons. This paper overcomes these
limitations of prior work with an end-to-end model for evidence-aware
credibility assessment of arbitrary textual claims, without any human
intervention. It presents a neural network model that judiciously aggregates
signals from external evidence articles, the language of these articles and the
trustworthiness of their sources. It also derives informative features for
generating user-comprehensible explanations that makes the neural network
predictions transparent to the end-user. Experiments with four datasets and

minority of participants reject information that is incongruent with their
preexisting beliefs. This simple mechanism generates permanent opinion
polarization and cascade dynamics, and accounts for the aforementioned tradeoff

"Practical solutions to bootstrap security in today's information and
communication systems critically depend on centralized services for
authentication as well as key and trust management. This is particularly true
for mobile users. Identity providers such as Google or Facebook have active
user bases of two billion each, and the subscriber number of mobile operators
exceeds five billion unique users as of early 2018. If these centralized
services go completely `dark' due to natural or man made disasters, large scale
blackouts, or country-wide censorship, the users are left without practical
solutions to bootstrap security on their mobile devices. Existing distributed
solutions, for instance, the so-called web-of-trust are not sufficiently
lightweight. Furthermore, they support neither cross-application on mobile
devices nor strong protection of key material using hardware security modules.
We propose Sea of Lights(SoL), a practical lightweight scheme for bootstrapping

self-organized networks. It is tailored to operate `in the dark' and provides
strong protection of key material as well as an intuitive means to build a

"In this work, we consider misinformation propagating through a social network
and study the problem of its prevention. In this problem, a ""bad"" campaign
starts propagating from a set of seed nodes in the network and we use the
notion of a limiting (or ""good"") campaign to counteract the effect of
misinformation. The goal is to identify a set of $k$ users that need to be
convinced to adopt the limiting campaign so as to minimize the number of people
that adopt the ""bad"" campaign at the end of both propagation processes.
  This work presents \emph{RPS} (Reverse Prevention Sampling), an algorithm
that provides a scalable solution to the misinformation mitigation problem. Our
theoretical analysis shows that \emph{RPS} runs in $O((k + l)(n + m)(\frac{1}{1

\epsilon)$-approximate solution with at least $1 - n^{-l}$ probability (where
$\gamma$ is a typically small network parameter and $l$ is a confidence
parameter). The time complexity of \emph{RPS} substantially improves upon the
previously best-known algorithms that run in time $\Omega(m n k \cdot
POLY(\epsilon^{-1}))$. We experimentally evaluate \emph{RPS} on large datasets

proposing a novel class of diffusion models, inspired by the classic Linear
Threshold model, and built around the following aspects: trust/distrust in the
user relationships, which is leveraged to model different effects of social
influence on the decisions taken by an individual; changes in adopting one or
alternative information items; hesitation towards adopting an information item
over time; latency in the propagation; time horizon for the unfolding of the
diffusion process; and multiple cascades of information that might occur
competitively. To the best of our knowledge, the above aspects have never been
unified into the same LT-based diffusion model. We also define different
strategies for the selection of the initial influencers to simulate

"The advent of WWW changed the way we can produce and access information.
Recent studies showed that users tend to select information that is consistent

environment, users cooperate to frame and reinforce their shared narrative
making any attempt at debunking inefficient. Such a configuration occurs even
in the consumption of news online, and considering that 63% of users access
news directly form social media, one hypothesis is that more polarization
allows for further spreading of misinformation. Along this path, we focus on
the polarization of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European
countries (Italy, France, Spain and Germany). First, we compare the pages'
posting behavior and the users' interacting patterns across countries and
observe different posting, liking and commenting rates. Second, we explore the
tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., selective exposure)

polarization of communities for each country. We find that Italy is the most
polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain. Finally, we
present a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence

"Fake news may be intentionally created to promote economic, political and

decisions. Hence, detection of fake news is an emerging problem that has become
extremely prevalent during the last few years. Most existing works on this
topic focus on manual feature extraction and supervised classification models
leveraging a large number of labeled (fake or real) articles. In contrast, we
focus on content-based detection of fake news articles, while assuming that we
have a small amount of labels, made available by manual fact-checkers or
automated sources. We argue this is a more realistic setting in the presence of
massive amounts of content, most of which cannot be easily factchecked. To that
end, we represent collections of news articles as multi-dimensional tensors,
leverage tensor decomposition to derive concise article embeddings that capture
spatial/contextual information about each news article, and use those
embeddings to create an article-by-article graph on which we propagate limited
labels. Results on three real-world datasets show that our method performs on

social and political issues. However, this powerful communication platform has
come under scrutiny for allowing hostile actors to exploit online discussions
in an attempt to manipulate public opinion. A case in point is the ongoing U.S.
Congress' investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election
campaign, with Russia accused of using trolls (malicious accounts created to
manipulate) and bots to spread misinformation and politically biased
information. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation
campaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on
Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress
investigation. We collected a dataset with over 43 million election-related
posts shared on Twitter between September 16 and October 21, 2016, by about 5.7
million distinct users. This dataset included accounts associated with the
identified Russian trolls. We use label propagation to infer the ideology of
all users based on the news sources they shared. This method enables us to
classify a large number of users as liberal or conservative with precision and
recall above 90%. Conservatives retweeted Russian trolls about 31 times more
often than liberals and produced 36x more tweets. Additionally, most retweets
of troll content originated from two Southern states: Tennessee and Texas.
Using state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimated that about 4.9%
and 6.2% of liberal and conservative users respectively were bots. Text
analysis on the content shared by trolls reveals that they had a mostly
conservative, pro-Trump agenda. Although an ideologically broad swath of
Twitter users was exposed to Russian Trolls in the period leading up to the
2016 U.S. Presidential election, it was mainly conservatives who helped amplify
their message.","['Adam Badawy', 'Emilio Ferrara', 'Kristina Lerman']",10,0.80658513

"This paper examines how an event from one random variable provides pointwise
mutual information about an event from another variable via probability mass
exclusions. We start by introducing probability mass diagrams, which provide a
visual representation of how a prior distribution is transformed to a posterior
distribution through exclusions. With the aid of these diagrams, we identify
two distinct types of probability mass exclusions---namely informative and
misinformative exclusions. Then, motivated by Fano's derivation of the
pointwise mutual information, we propose four postulates which aim to decompose
the pointwise mutual information into two separate informational components: a
non-negative term associated with the informative exclusion and a non-positive
term associated with the misinformative exclusions. This yields a novel
derivation of a familiar decomposition of the pointwise mutual information into
entropic components. We conclude by discussing the relevance of considering
information in terms of probability mass exclusions to the ongoing effort to
decompose multivariate information.","['Conor Finn', 'Joseph T Lizier']",2,0.622061
"In this paper, the problem of misinformation propagation is studied for an
Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker seeks to
inject false information in the IoBT nodes in order to compromise the IoBT
operations. In the considered model, each IoBT node seeks to counter the
misinformation attack by finding the optimal probability of accepting a given
information that minimizes its cost at each time instant. The cost is expressed
in terms of the quality of information received as well as the infection cost.
The problem is formulated as a mean-field game with multiclass agents which is
suitable to model a massive heterogeneous IoBT system. For this game, the
mean-field equilibrium is characterized, and an algorithm based on the forward
backward sweep method is proposed to find the mean-field equilibrium. Then, the
finite IoBT case is considered, and the conditions of convergence of the Nash
equilibria in the finite case to the mean-field equilibrium are presented.
Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a 1.2-fold increase
in the quality of information (QoI) compared to a baseline scheme in which the
IoBT nodes are always transmitting. The results also show that the proposed
scheme can reduce the proportion of infected nodes by 99% compared to the
baseline.","['Nof Abuzainab', 'Walid Saad']",2,0.7146411
"Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over

Hoaxy filters public tweets that include links to unverified claims or

"As political polarization in the United States continues to rise, the
question of whether polarized individuals can fruitfully cooperate becomes
pressing. Although diversity of individual perspectives typically leads to
superior team performance on complex tasks, strong political perspectives have
been associated with conflict, misinformation and a reluctance to engage with
people and perspectives beyond one's echo chamber. It is unclear whether
self-selected teams of politically diverse individuals will create higher or
lower quality outcomes. In this paper, we explore the effect of team political
composition on performance through analysis of millions of edits to Wikipedia's
Political, Social Issues, and Science articles. We measure editors' political
alignments by their contributions to conservative versus liberal articles. A
survey of editors validates that those who primarily edit liberal articles
identify more strongly with the Democratic party and those who edit
conservative ones with the Republican party. Our analysis then reveals that
polarized teams---those consisting of a balanced set of politically diverse
editors---create articles of higher quality than politically homogeneous teams.
The effect appears most strongly in Wikipedia's Political articles, but is also
observed in Social Issues and even Science articles. Analysis of article ""talk
pages"" reveals that politically polarized teams engage in longer, more
constructive, competitive, and substantively focused but linguistically diverse
debates than political moderates. More intense use of Wikipedia policies by
politically diverse teams suggests institutional design principles to help
unleash the power of politically polarized teams.","['Feng Shi', 'Misha Teplitskiy', 'Eamon Duede', 'James Evans']",3,0.53489685
"Online social networking sites are experimenting with the following
crowd-powered procedure to reduce the spread of fake news and misinformation:
whenever a user is exposed to a story through her feed, she can flag the story
as misinformation and, if the story receives enough flags, it is sent to a
trusted third party for fact checking. If this party identifies the story as
misinformation, it is marked as disputed. However, given the uncertain number
of exposures, the high cost of fact checking, and the trade-off between flags
and exposures, the above mentioned procedure requires careful reasoning and
smart algorithms which, to the best of our knowledge, do not exist to date.
  In this paper, we first introduce a flexible representation of the above
procedure using the framework of marked temporal point processes. Then, we
develop a scalable online algorithm, Curb, to select which stories to send for
fact checking and when to do so to efficiently reduce the spread of
misinformation with provable guarantees. In doing so, we need to solve a novel
stochastic optimal control problem for stochastic differential equations with

"Our work considers leveraging crowd signals for detecting fake news and is
motivated by tools recently introduced by Facebook that enable users to flag
fake news. By aggregating users' flags, our goal is to select a small subset of
news every day, send them to an expert (e.g., via a third-party fact-checking
organization), and stop the spread of news identified as fake by an expert. The
main objective of our work is to minimize the spread of misinformation by
stopping the propagation of fake news in the network. It is especially
challenging to achieve this objective as it requires detecting fake news with
high-confidence as quickly as possible. We show that in order to leverage
users' flags efficiently, it is crucial to learn about users' flagging
accuracy. We develop a novel algorithm, DETECTIVE, that performs Bayesian
inference for detecting fake news and jointly learns about users' flagging
accuracy over time. Our algorithm employs posterior sampling to actively trade
off exploitation (selecting news that maximize the objective value at a given
epoch) and exploration (selecting news that maximize the value of information
towards learning about users' flagging accuracy). We demonstrate the

"Election control considers the problem of an adversary who attempts to tamper

strategies is computationally feasible. We consider two objectives for the
adversary in both the constructive and destructive control settings:
probability and margin of victory (POV and MOV, respectively). We present
several strong negative results, showing, for example, that the problem of
maximizing POV is inapproximable for any constant factor. On the other hand, we
present approximation algorithms which provide somewhat weaker approximation
guarantees, such as bicriteria approximations for the POV objective and
constant-factor approximations for MOV. Finally, we present mixed integer

"Misinformation and rumor can spread rapidly and widely through online social

more realistic scenario when there are multiple positive cascades generated by
different agents. For the multiple-cascade diffusion, we propose the P2P
independent cascade (PIC) model for private social communications. The main
part of this paper is an analysis of the rumor blocking effect (i.e. the number
of the users activated by rumor) when the agents non-cooperatively generate the
positive cascades. We show that the rumor blocking effect provided by the Nash
equilibrium will not be arbitrarily worse even if the positive cascades are
generated non-cooperatively. In addition, we give a discussion on how the
cascade priority and activation order affect the rumor blocking problem. We

"Recent work have done a good job in modeling rumors and detecting them over

features) are not mature and distinctive enough. The objective of rumor
debunking in microblogs, however, are to detect these misinformation as early

representations of individual rumor-related tweets at the very beginning of a
rumor. Our extensive experiments show that the resulting signal improves our
classification performance over time, significantly within the first 10 hours.
To deepen the understanding of these low and high-level features in
contributing to the model performance over time, we conduct an extensive study

these attacks cheap and therefore more scalable, but they can control rate of
content output to eliminate the signature burstiness that makes crowdsourced

"It is generally accepted that, when moving in groups, animals process
information to coordinate their motion. Recent studies have begun to apply
rigorous methods based on Information Theory to quantify such distributed
computation. Following this perspective, we use transfer entropy to quantify
dynamic information flows locally in space and time across a school of fish
during directional changes around a circular tank, i.e. U-turns. This analysis
reveals peaks in information flows during collective U-turns and identifies two
different flows: an informative flow (positive transfer entropy) based on fish
that have already turned about fish that are turning, and a misinformative flow
(negative transfer entropy) based on fish that have not turned yet about fish
that are turning. We also reveal that the information flows are related to
relative position and alignment between fish, and identify spatial patterns of
information and misinformation cascades. This study offers several
methodological contributions and we expect further application of these
methodologies to reveal intricacies of self-organisation in other animal groups
and active matter in general.","['Emanuele Crosato', 'Li Jiang', 'Valentin Lecheval', 'Joseph T. Lizier', 'X. Rosalind Wang', 'Pierre Tichit', 'Guy Theraulaz', 'Mikhail Prokopenko']",2,0.5551394
"In recent years, the reliability of information on the Internet has emerged
as a crucial issue of modern society. Social network sites (SNSs) have
revolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to
freely share content. As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as
vectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes. The amount of
disseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically
impossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for
automatic hoax detection systems.
  As a contribution towards this objective, we show that Facebook posts can be
classified with high accuracy as hoaxes or non-hoaxes on the basis of the users
who ""liked"" them. We present two classification techniques, one based on
logistic regression, the other on a novel adaptation of boolean crowdsourcing
algorithms. On a dataset consisting of 15,500 Facebook posts and 909,236 users,
we obtain classification accuracies exceeding 99% even when the training set
contains less than 1% of the posts. We further show that our techniques are
robust: they work even when we restrict our attention to the users who like
both hoax and non-hoax posts. These results suggest that mapping the diffusion
pattern of information can be a useful component of automatic hoax detection
systems.","['Eugenio Tacchini', 'Gabriele Ballarin', 'Marco L. Della Vedova', 'Stefano Moret', 'Luca de Alfaro']",4,0.7166375
"Chatbots are one class of intelligent, conversational software agents
activated by natural language input (which can be in the form of text, voice,
or both). They provide conversational output in response, and if commanded, can
sometimes also execute tasks. Although chatbot technologies have existed since
the 1960s and have influenced user interface development in games since the
early 1980s, chatbots are now easier to train and implement. This is due to
plentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and
implementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to
enhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be
used to engineer social harm - that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or
attack people for posting their thoughts and opinions online. This paper
presents a literature review of quality issues and attributes as they relate to
the contemporary issue of chatbot development and implementation. Finally,
quality assessment approaches are reviewed, and a quality assessment method
based on these attributes and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed
and examined.","['Nicole M. Radziwill', 'Morgan C. Benton']",13,0.6271292

"In 2010, a paper entitled ""From Obscurity to Prominence in Minutes: Political
Speech and Real-time search"" won the Best Paper Prize of the Web Science 2010
Conference. Among its findings were the discovery and documentation of what was
termed a ""Twitter-bomb"", an organized effort to spread misinformation about the
democratic candidate Martha Coakley through anonymous Twitter accounts. In this
paper, after summarizing the details of that event, we outline the recipe of
how social networks are used to spread misinformation. One of the most
important steps in such a recipe is the ""infiltration"" of a community of users
who are already engaged in conversations about a topic, to use them as organic
spreaders of misinformation in their extended subnetworks. Then, we take this
misinformation spreading recipe and indicate how it was successfully used to
spread fake news during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The main
differences between the scenarios are the use of Facebook instead of Twitter,
and the respective motivations (in 2010: political influence; in 2016:
financial benefit through online advertising). After situating these events in
the broader context of exploiting the Web, we seize this opportunity to address
limitations of the reach of research findings and to start a conversation about
how communities of researchers can increase their impact on real-world societal
issues.","['Eni Mustafaraj', 'Panagiotis Takis Metaxas']",10,0.7424582
"The topic of fake news has drawn attention both from the public and the
academic communities. Such misinformation has the potential of affecting public
opinion, providing an opportunity for malicious parties to manipulate the
outcomes of public events such as elections. Because such high stakes are at
play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging
problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three
generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the
user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has
largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which
has limited their success and generality. In this work, we propose a model that
combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated
prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users
and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news.
Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is
composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is
based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture
the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module
learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two
are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not.
Experimental analysis on real-world data demonstrates that CSI achieves higher
accuracy than existing models, and extracts meaningful latent representations
of both users and articles.","['Natali Ruchansky', 'Sungyong Seo', 'Yan Liu']",4,0.77665615
"The rising attention to the spreading of fake news and unsubstantiated rumors
on online social media and the pivotal role played by confirmation bias led
researchers to investigate different aspects of the phenomenon. Experimental
evidence showed that confirmatory information gets accepted even if containing
deliberately false claims while dissenting information is mainly ignored or
might even increase group polarization. It seems reasonable that, to address
misinformation problem properly, we have to understand the main determinants
behind content consumption and the emergence of narratives on online social
media. In this paper we address such a challenge by focusing on the discussion
around the Italian Constitutional Referendum by conducting a quantitative,
cross-platform analysis on both Facebook public pages and Twitter accounts. We
observe the spontaneous emergence of well-separated communities on both
platforms. Such a segregation is completely spontaneous, since no
categorization of contents was performed a priori. By exploring the dynamics
behind the discussion, we find that users tend to restrict their attention to a
specific set of Facebook pages/Twitter accounts. Finally, taking advantage of
automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis techniques, we are able to
identify the most controversial topics inside and across both platforms. We
measure the distance between how a certain topic is presented in the
posts/tweets and the related emotional response of users. Our results provide
interesting insights for the understanding of the evolution of the core
narratives behind different echo chambers and for the early detection of
massive viral phenomena around false claims.","['Michela Del Vicario', 'Sabrina Gaito', 'Walter Quattrociocchi', 'Matteo Zignani', 'Fabiana Zollo']",3,0.8856925
"Obtaining meaningful quantitative descriptions of the statistical dependence
within multivariate systems is a difficult open problem. Recently, the Partial
Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information
(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and
synergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose
to apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in
a Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy
redundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition
which is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can
reveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that
are indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective
also shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself
includes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships
between the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative
information decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This
reveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset
of the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in
part why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows
separate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of
the system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between
inputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The
new perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties
encountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide
useful tools for practical data analysis across a wide range of application
areas.",['Robin A. A. Ince'],2,0.6779827
"The purpose of this study was to do a dataset distribution analysis, a
classification performance analysis, and a topical analysis concerning what
people are tweeting about four disease characteristics: symptoms, transmission,
prevention, and treatment. A combination of natural language processing and
machine learning techniques were used to determine what people are tweeting
about Zika. Specifically, a two-stage classifier system was built to find
relevant tweets on Zika, and then categorize these into the four disease
categories. Tweets in each disease category were then examined using latent
dirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the five main tweet topics for each
disease characteristic. Results 1,234,605 tweets were collected. Tweets by
males and females were similar (28% and 23% respectively). The classifier
performed well on the training and test data for relevancy (F=0.87 and 0.99
respectively) and disease characteristics (F=0.79 and 0.90 respectively). Five
topics for each category were found and discussed with a focus on the symptoms
category. Through this process, we demonstrate how misinformation can be

"Given the huge impact that Online Social Networks (OSN) had in the way people
get informed and form their opinion, they became an attractive playground for
malicious entities that want to spread misinformation, and leverage their
effect. In fact, misinformation easily spreads on OSN and is a huge threat for
modern society, possibly influencing also the outcome of elections, or even
putting people's life at risk (e.g., spreading ""anti-vaccines"" misinformation).
Therefore, it is of paramount importance for our society to have some sort of
""validation"" on information spreading through OSN. The need for a wide-scale
validation would greatly benefit from automatic tools.
  In this paper, we show that it is difficult to carry out an automatic
classification of misinformation considering only structural properties of
content propagation cascades. We focus on structural properties, because they
would be inherently difficult to be manipulated, with the the aim of
circumventing classification systems. To support our claim, we carry out an
extensive evaluation on Facebook posts belonging to conspiracy theories (as
representative of misinformation), and scientific news (representative of
fact-checked content). Our findings show that conspiracy content actually
reverberates in a way which is hard to distinguish from the one scientific
content does: for the classification mechanisms we investigated, classification
F1-score never exceeds 0.65 during content propagation stages, and is still
less than 0.7 even after propagation is complete.","['Mauro Conti', 'Daniele Lain', 'Riccardo Lazzeretti', 'Giulio Lovisotto', 'Walter Quattrociocchi']",3,0.74719346
"Social media are massive marketplaces where ideas and news compete for our
attention. Previous studies have shown that quality is not a necessary
condition for online virality and that knowledge about peer choices can distort
the relationship between quality and popularity. However, these results do not
explain the viral spread of low-quality information, such as the digital
misinformation that threatens our democracy. We investigate quality
discrimination in a stylized model of online social network, where individual
agents prefer quality information, but have behavioral limitations in managing
a heavy flow of information. We measure the relationship between the quality of
an idea and its likelihood to become prevalent at the system level. We find
that both information overload and limited attention contribute to a
degradation in the market's discriminative power. A good tradeoff between
discriminative power and diversity of information is possible according to the
model. However, calibration with empirical data characterizing information load
and finite attention in real social media reveals a weak correlation between
quality and popularity of information. In these realistic conditions, the model
predicts that high-quality information has little advantage over low-quality
information.","['Xiaoyan Qiu', 'Diego F. M. Oliveira', 'Alireza Sahami Shirazi', 'Alessandro Flammini', 'Filippo Menczer']",0,0.65509176
"Social networks allow rapid spread of ideas and innovations while the
negative information can also propagate widely. When the cascades with
different opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first is the
most likely to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is
detected, a natural containment method is to introduce a positive cascade
competing against the rumor. Given a budget $k$, the rumor blocking problem
asks for $k$ seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that
the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The
prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated
within a factor of $(1-1/e-\delta)$ by a classic greedy algorithm combined with
Monte Carlo simulation with the running time of $O(\frac{k^3mn\ln
n}{\delta^2})$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of users and edges,
respectively. Unfortunately, the Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods are
extremely time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance
guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a
randomized algorithm which runs in $O(\frac{km\ln n}{\delta^2})$ expected time
and provides a $(1-1/e-\delta)$-approximation with a high probability. The
experimentally results on both the real-world and synthetic social networks

efficient than the state-of-the-art method and it is able to find the seed

"While social networks can provide an ideal platform for up-to-date

trustworthiness measures including the authors' profile and past behaviour, the
social network connections (graphs), and the content of tweets themselves. We
ran modern machine-learning classifiers over those measures to produce
trustworthiness scores at various time windows from the outbreak of the rumour.
Such time-windows were key as they allowed useful insight into the progression
of the rumours. From our findings, we identified that our model was
significantly more accurate than similar studies in the literature. We also
identified critical attributes of the data that give rise to the
trustworthiness scores assigned. Finally we developed a software demonstration

"Online Social Networks explode with activity whenever a crisis event takes

topics of interest and gauge the pulse and sentiment of citizens. While
multiple researchers have used text to identify, analyze and measure themes and
public sentiment during such events, little work has explored visual themes
floating on networks in the form of images, and the sentiment inspired by them.

popular in images, but were not identifiable through text. We uncovered
instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular
image themes, which were not prominent in user generated textual content, and
can be of particular inter- est to first responders. Our analysis also revealed
that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative

"Misinformation under the form of rumor, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories
spreads on social media at alarming rates. One hypothesis is that, since social
media are shaped by homophily, belief in misinformation may be more likely to
thrive on those social circles that are segregated from the rest of the
network. One possible antidote is fact checking which, in some cases, is known
to stop rumors from spreading further. However, fact checking may also backfire
and reinforce the belief in a hoax. Here we take into account the combination
of network segregation, finite memory and attention, and fact-checking efforts.
We consider a compartmental model of two interacting epidemic processes over a
network that is segregated between gullible and skeptic users. Extensive
simulation and mean-field analysis show that a more segregated network
facilitates the spread of a hoax only at low forgetting rates, but has no
effect when agents forget at faster rates. This finding may inform the
development of mitigation techniques and overall inform on the risks of
uncontrolled misinformation online.","['Marcella Tambuscio', 'Diego F. M. Oliveira', 'Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia', 'Giancarlo Ruffo']",3,0.70926964

"Social media have quickly become a prevalent channel to access information,
spread ideas, and influence opinions. However, it has been suggested that
social and algorithmic filtering may cause exposure to less diverse points of
view, and even foster polarization and misinformation. Here we explore and
validate this hypothesis quantitatively for the first time, at the collective
and individual levels, by mining three massive datasets of web traffic, search
logs, and Twitter posts. Our analysis shows that collectively, people access
information from a significantly narrower spectrum of sources through social
media and email, compared to search. The significance of this finding for
individual exposure is revealed by investigating the relationship between the
diversity of information sources experienced by users at the collective and
individual level. There is a strong correlation between collective and
individual diversity, supporting the notion that when we use social media we
find ourselves inside ""social bubbles"". Our results could lead to a deeper
understanding of how technology biases our exposure to new information.","['Dimitar Nikolov', 'Diego F. M. Oliveira', 'Alessandro Flammini', 'Filippo Menczer']",3,0.7612633

checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of
dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking

Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient
computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of
thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and
biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from
Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive
higher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a

"This paper considers online reputation and polling systems where individuals
make recommendations based on their private observations and recommendations of
friends. Such interaction of individuals and their social influence is modelled
as social learning on a directed acyclic graph. Data incest (misinformation
propagation) occurs due to unintentional re-use of identical actions in the
for- mation of public belief in social learning; the information gathered by
each agent is mistakenly considered to be independent. This results in
overconfidence and bias in estimates of the state. Necessary and sufficient
conditions are given on the structure of information exchange graph to mitigate
data incest. Incest removal algorithms are presented. Experimental results on
human subjects are presented to illustrate the effect of social influence and
data incest on decision making. These experimental results indicate that social
learning protocols require careful design to handle and mitigate data incest.
The incest removal algorithms are illustrated in an expectation polling system
where participants in a poll respond with a summary of their friends' beliefs.
Finally, the principle of revealed preferences arising in micro-economics
theory is used to parse Twitter datasets to determine if social sensors are
utility maximizers and then determine their utility functions.","['Vikram Krishnamurthy', 'William Hoiles']",3,0.6451356
"Social media have become part of modern news reporting, used by journalists
to spread information and find sources, or as a news source by individuals. The
quest for prominence and recognition on social media sites like Twitter can
sometimes eclipse accuracy and lead to the spread of false information. As a
way to study and react to this trend, we introduce {\sc TwitterTrails}, an
interactive, web-based tool ({\tt twittertrails.com}) that allows users to
investigate the origin and propagation characteristics of a rumor and its
refutation, if any, on Twitter. Visualizations of burst activity, propagation
timeline, retweet and co-retweeted networks help its users trace the spread of
a story. Within minutes {\sc TwitterTrails} will collect relevant tweets and
automatically answer several important questions regarding a rumor: its
originator, burst characteristics, propagators and main actors according to the
audience. In addition, it will compute and report the rumor's level of
visibility and, as an example of the power of crowdsourcing, the audience's
skepticism towards it which correlates with the rumor's credibility. We
envision {\sc TwitterTrails} as valuable tool for individual use, but we
especially for amateur and professional journalists investigating recent and
breaking stories. Further, its expanding collection of investigated rumors can
be used to answer questions regarding the amount and success of misinformation

"The spreading of unsubstantiated rumors on online social networks (OSN)

trolling) can have serious consequences such as in the recent case of rumors
about Ebola causing disruption to health-care workers. Here we show that
indicators aimed at quantifying information consumption patterns might provide
important insights about the virality of false claims. In particular, we
address the driving forces behind the popularity of contents by analyzing a
sample of 1.2M Facebook Italian users consuming different (and opposite) types
of information (science and conspiracy news). We show that users' engagement
across different contents correlates with the number of friends having similar
consumption patterns (homophily), indicating the area in the social network
where certain types of contents are more likely to spread. Then, we test
diffusion patterns on an external sample of $4,709$ intentional satirical false
claims showing that neither the presence of hubs (structural properties) nor
the most active users (influencers) are prevalent in viral phenomena. Instead,
we found out that in an environment where misinformation is pervasive, users'
aggregation around shared beliefs may make the usual exposure to conspiracy
stories (polarization) a determinant for the virality of false information.","['Aris Anagnostopoulos', 'Alessandro Bessi', 'Guido Caldarelli', 'Michela Del Vicario', 'Fabio Petroni', 'Antonio Scala', 'Fabiana Zollo', 'Walter Quattrociocchi']",3,0.77558327
"Despite the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so called \emph{collective

their dissemination. Users preferentially consume information according to
their system of beliefs and the strife within users of opposite narratives may
result in heated debates. In this work we provide a genuine example of
information consumption from a sample of 1.2 million of Facebook Italian users.
We show by means of a thorough quantitative analysis that information
supporting different worldviews -- i.e. scientific and conspiracist news -- are
consumed in a comparable way by their respective users. Moreover, we measure
the effect of the exposure to 4709 evidently false information (satirical
version of conspiracy theses) and to 4502 debunking memes (information aiming
at contrasting unsubstantiated rumors) of the most polarized users of

used as the mathematical basis for modelling interaction of individuals that
aim to perform a perceptual task interactively. A psychology experiment was
conducted on a group of undergraduate students at the University of British
Columbia to examine whether the decision (action) of one individual affects the
decision of the subsequent individuals. The major experimental observation that
stands out here is that the participants of the experiment (agents) were
affected by decisions of their partners in a relatively large fraction (60%) of
trials. We fit a social learning model that mimics the interactions between

"The spread of rumors through social media and online social networks can not
only disrupt the daily lives of citizens but also result in loss of life and
property. A rumor spreads when individuals, who are unable decide the
authenticity of the information, mistake the rumor as genuine information and
pass it on to their acquaintances. We propose a solution where a set of
individuals (based on their degree) in the social network are trained and
provided resources to help them distinguish a rumor from genuine information.
By formulating an optimization problem we calculate the optimum set of
individuals, who must undergo training, and the quality of training that
minimizes the expected training cost and ensures an upper bound on the size of
the rumor outbreak. Our primary contribution is that although the optimization
problem turns out to be non convex, we show that the problem is equivalent to
solving a set of linear programs. This result also allows us to solve the
problem of minimizing the size of rumor outbreak for a given cost budget. The
optimum solution displays an interesting pattern which can be implemented as a
heuristic. These results can prove to be very useful for social planners and
law enforcement agencies for preventing dangerous rumors and misinformation
epidemics.","['Bhushan Kotnis', 'Joy Kuri']",2,0.59949374
"In this work we study, on a sample of 2.3 million individuals, how Facebook

(mainly conspiracy theories) reverberate for as long as other information.
Finally, we categorize users according to their interaction patterns among the
different topics and measure how a sample of this social ecosystem (1279 users)

give of this fundamental result in greedy approximation relies on a fallacious

"The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to
study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their
massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between
different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns
versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal
definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to
person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised
learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication.
The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from
existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for
the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of
social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content,
metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of
pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is
carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis
shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the
best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that
a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as
effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully
automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in
streaming data.","['Emilio Ferrara', 'Mohsen JafariAsbagh', 'Onur Varol', 'Vahed Qazvinian', 'Filippo Menczer', 'Alessandro Flammini']",2,0.77349114
"Viral spread on large graphs has many real-life applications such as malware
propagation in computer networks and rumor (or misinformation) spread in
Twitter-like online social networks. Although viral spread on large graphs has
been intensively analyzed on classical models such as
Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, there still exits a deficit of effective
methods in practice to contain epidemic spread once it passes a critical
threshold. Against this backdrop, we explore methods of containing viral spread
in large networks with the focus on sparse random networks. The viral
containment strategy is to partition a large network into small components and
then to ensure the sanity of all messages delivered across different
components. With such a defense mechanism in place, an epidemic spread starting
from any node is limited to only those nodes belonging to the same component as
the initial infection node. We establish both lower and upper bounds on the
costs of inspecting inter-component messages. We further propose
heuristic-based approaches to partition large input graphs into small
components. Finally, we study the performance of our proposed algorithms under
different network topologies and different edge weight models.","['Milan Bradonjić', 'Michael Molloy', 'Guanhua Yan']",2,0.77263415

psychological, and political. Political explanations have been seen to be the
most dominant explanations for cost overruns. Agency theory is considered the
most interesting for political explanations and an eclectic theory is also
considered possible. Nonpolitical explanations are diverse in character,
therefore a range of different theories (including rational choice theory and

"Consider a complete communication network on $n$ nodes, each of which is a
state machine. In synchronous 2-counting, the nodes receive a common clock
pulse and they have to agree on which pulses are ""odd"" and which are ""even"". We
require that the solution is self-stabilising (reaching the correct operation
from any initial state) and it tolerates $f$ Byzantine failures (nodes that
send arbitrary misinformation). Prior algorithms are expensive to implement in
hardware: they require a source of random bits or a large number of states.
  This work consists of two parts. In the first part, we use computational
techniques (often known as synthesis) to construct very compact deterministic
algorithms for the first non-trivial case of $f = 1$. While no algorithm exists
for $n < 4$, we show that as few as 3 states per node are sufficient for all
values $n \ge 4$. Moreover, the problem cannot be solved with only 2 states per
node for $n = 4$, but there is a 2-state solution for all values $n \ge 6$.
  In the second part, we develop and compare two different approaches for
synthesising synchronous counting algorithms. Both approaches are based on
casting the synthesis problem as a propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem
and employing modern SAT-solvers. The difference lies in how to solve the SAT
problem: either in a direct fashion, or incrementally within a counter-example
guided abstraction refinement loop. Empirical results suggest that the former
technique is more efficient if we want to synthesise time-optimal algorithms,
while the latter technique discovers non-optimal algorithms more quickly.","['Danny Dolev', 'Keijo Heljanko', 'Matti Järvisalo', 'Janne H. Korhonen', 'Christoph Lenzen', 'Joel Rybicki', 'Jukka Suomela', 'Siert Wieringa']",2,0.5184398

"We provide a model to investigate the tension between information aggregation
and spread of misinformation in large societies (conceptualized as networks of
agents communicating with each other). Each individual holds a belief
represented by a scalar. Individuals meet pairwise and exchange information,
which is modeled as both individuals adopting the average of their pre-meeting
beliefs. When all individuals engage in this type of information exchange, the
society will be able to effectively aggregate the initial information held by
all individuals. There is also the possibility of misinformation, however,
because some of the individuals are ""forceful,"" meaning that they influence the
beliefs of (some) of the other individuals they meet, but do not change their
own opinion. The paper characterizes how the presence of forceful agents
interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even
forceful agents obtain some information (however infrequent) from some others
(and additional weak regularity conditions), we first show that beliefs in this
class of societies converge to a consensus among all individuals. This
consensus value is a random variable, however, and we characterize its
behavior. Our main results quantify the extent of misinformation in the society
by either providing bounds or exact results (in some special cases) on how far
the consensus value can be from the benchmark without forceful agents (where
there is efficient information aggregation). The worst outcomes obtain when
there are several forceful agents and forceful agents themselves update their
beliefs only on the basis of information they obtain from individuals most
likely to have received their own information previously.","['Daron Acemoglu', 'Asuman Ozdaglar', 'Ali ParandehGheibi']",3,0.6888996

"Even professional baseball players occasionally find it difficult to
gracefully approach seemingly routine pop-ups. This paper describes a set of
towering pop-ups with trajectories that exhibit cusps and loops near the apex.
For a normal fly ball, the horizontal velocity is continuously decreasing due
to drag caused by air resistance. But for pop-ups, the Magnus force (the force
due to the ball spinning in a moving airflow) is larger than the drag force. In
these cases the horizontal velocity decreases in the beginning, like a normal
fly ball, but after the apex, the Magnus force accelerates the horizontal
motion. We refer to this class of pop-ups as paradoxical because they appear to
misinform the typically robust optical control strategies used by fielders and
lead to systematic vacillation in running paths, especially when a trajectory
terminates near the fielder. In short, some of the dancing around when
infielders pursue pop-ups can be well explained as a combination of bizarre
trajectories and misguidance by the normally reliable optical control strategy,
